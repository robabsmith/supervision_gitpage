# Literature searching

Literature searches can be completed in a number of ways. There are several very useful free literature search options, as well as more expensive options that you will have access to as a university student.

## Free search options

  1. [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com)
  2. [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org)
  
## Paid search options

These options are very effectively combined and the University library website. Where the *Primo* service can be used to search a wide variety of databases for a specific search string (or phrase).

  1. [Aalborg University Universitetsbiblioteket](https://www.en.aub.aau.dk)

The university site also allows students to access each of the available underlying databases individually and use the special search features that are available for each. Several of these databases allow for bulk exportation of bibliographic information, and can be easily synchronised with referencing software described in the section above.

# Appendix: Literature search construction

## Project title
Stock-flow consistent models – property and mortgage

## Description of subject
Stock flow consistent model to cover mortgage debt of the household sector

## Problem statement for project
Debt to disposable income levels in several Danish sectors have risen to the highest ever recorded levels, while the Danish central bank (Danmarks nationalbank), the IMF and Finanstilsynet all report that there are no serious threats to financial stability. Financial deregulation, relaxation of borrowing criteria and product innovation have been cited as the leading causes of this trend. This thesis aims to explore credit creation and macro-financial risks related to the expansion of household debt in Denmark by examining institutional sector and individual household balance sheets.

## Search criteria development

### Step 01: List all concepts

1.	Stock Flow Consistent Models
2.	Structural Econometric Models
3.	Mortgage debt
4.	Housing market
5.	Macroeconomic models
6.	Post Keynesian theory
7.	Denmark
8.	Households
9.	Sector balance analysis
10.	Household debt

### Step 02: Group words into “Blocks” of concepts

1.	“Stock Flow Consistent Models” OR “Structural Econometric Models” OR “Sector balance analysis”
2.	“Macroeconomic”
3.	“Mortgage debt” OR “Housing market”
4.	“Post Keynesian theory”
5.	“Denmark”
6.	“Households”
7.	“debt” OR Credit”

### Step 03: Check for any synonyms (and use MS Word to check for spelling errors)

1.	“Stock Flow Consistent Models” OR “stock flow consistent” OR “Stock-flow consistent” OR “SFC models” OR “SFC” OR “Structural Econometric Models” OR “Structural econometric” OR “SEM models” OR “Sector balance analysis” OR “SBA” OR “Sector financial balances”
2.	“Macroeconomic model” OR “National model” OR “aggregate model”
3.	“Mortgage debt” OR “mortgage bonds” OR “Mortgage credit” OR “mortgage borrowing” OR “Housing market”
4.	“Post Keynesian” OR “Post-keynesian”
5.	“Denmark” OR “Danish” OR “Nordic” OR “Scandinavian”
6.	“Households”
7.	“debt” OR Credit”

### Step 04: Add Boolean operators

1.	“Stock Flow Consistent Model\*” OR “stock flow consistent” OR “Stock-flow consistent” OR “SFC model\*” OR “SFC” OR “Structural Econometric Model\*” OR “Structural econometric” OR “SEM model\*” OR “Sector\* balance analysis” OR “SBA” OR “Sector\* financial balance\*”
2.	“Macroeconomic model\*” OR “National model\*” OR “aggregate model\*”
3.	“Mortgage debt” OR “mortgage bonds” OR “Mortgage credit” OR “mortgage borrowing” OR “Housing debt”
4.	“Post Keynesian” OR “Post-Keynesian”
5.	“Denmark” OR “Danish” OR “Nordic” OR “Scandinavian”
6.	“Household\*”
7.	“debt” OR Credit”

### Step 05: Prioritise blocks according to subject

**Starting with the most relevant first**

(“Stock Flow Consistent” OR “Stock-flow consistent” OR “SFC model\*”)

OR

(“Structural Econometric” OR “SEM model\*”)

AND

(“Macroeconomic model\*” OR “National model\*” OR “aggregate model\*” OR “sector\* model”)

AND

(“Mortgage debt” OR “mortgage bonds” OR “Mortgage credit” OR “mortgage borrowing” OR “Housing debt” OR “Housing market” OR “Property market” OR “Property Prices”)

AND

(“Post Keynesian” OR “Post-Keynesian”)

AND

(“Denmark\*” OR “Danish” OR “Nordic” OR “Scandinavia\*”)

AND

(“Household\*” OR “private sector”)

AND

(“debt” OR “Credit”)

**Optional alternative to add to SFC**
(“Sector\* balance analys\*” OR “Sector\* financial balance\*”)


### Step 06: Perform search block by block

### Step 07: Combine search blocks

### Step 08: Document search results and limitations

### Step 09: Compare results and refine search parameters
