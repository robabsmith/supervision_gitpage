# Supervision guide

This is a simple GitBook to assist students to write projects in partial fulfilment of the requirements of a degree in economics at Aalborg University.

The content is updated periodically, and can NOT be referred to as an official source. All regulations and study program guides take presidence over any content on this site.

The content is also personalised to the extent that I provide some information about when I will personally be unavailable. Apart from that, it is my hope that at least some of the content will be useful to students of all level.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
