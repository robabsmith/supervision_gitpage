abstract = {We propose a continuous-time stock-flow consistent model for inventory
dynamics in an economy with firms, banks, and households. On the supply
side, firms decide on production based on adaptive expectations for
sales demand and a desired level of inventories. On the demand side,
investment is determined as a function of utilization and profitability
and can be financed by debt, whereas consumption is independently
determined as a function of income and wealth. Prices adjust sluggishly
to both changes in labour costs and inventory. Disequilibrium between
expected sales and demand is absorbed by unplanned changes in inventory.
This results in a five-dimensional dynamical system for wage share,
employment rate, private debt ratio, expected sales, and capacity
utilization. We analyze two limiting cases: the long run dynamics
provides a version of the Keen model with effective demand and varying
inventories, whereas the short-run dynamics gives rise to behaviour that
we interpret as Kitchin cycles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

abstract = {Since German unification there have been dramatic and highly visible changes in the German financial system and relations between banks and firms in Germany. The traditional Hausbank system has weakened, as securities markets have become more important for both borrowers and savers. The demands of financial investors on how German firms manage themselves have-for better or worse-become increasingly influential in this time. In this article, I advance the thesis that bank-industry relations in Germany became increasingly differentiated, with one set of firms moving into an institutional environment readily characterized as market-based finance. Meanwhile, most German firms remain in a bank-based environment that, while not quite the same as the Hausbank model that prevailed at the time of unification, is still easily recognized as such. These changes in the financial system have had numerous consequences for the German economy, including increased pressure on firms to make greater profits and increased pressure on labor to limit wage gains and make concessions in the interest of corporate competitiveness.

abstract = {This paper emphasises the need for understanding the interdependencies between the real and financial side of the economy in macroeconomic models. While the real side of the economy is generally well-explained in macroeconomic models, the financial side of the economy and its interaction with the real economy remains poorly-understood. This paper makes an attempt to model the interdependencies between the real and financial side of the economy in Denmark while adopting a stock-flow-consistent approach. The model is estimated using Danish data for the period 1995-2016. The model is simulated to create a baseline scenario for the period 2017-2030, against which the effects of two standard shocks (fiscal shocks and interest rate shocks) are analysed. Overall, our model is able to replicate the stylized facts as will be discussed. While the model structure is fairly simple due to different constraints, the use of stock-flow approach makes it possible to explain several transmission mechanism through which real economic behaviour can affect the balance sheets, and at the same time capture the feedback effects from the balance sheets to the real economy. Finally, we discuss certain limitations of our model.},

@phdthesis{Milner2018,
abstract = {"Robbing Peter to Pay Paul: Business, Government, and Wage-Price Policy, 1945-1980," explores efforts to solve one of the most vexing problems of 20 th century American political economy: how to achieve full employment without inflation. According to the conventional chronology of American political economy, the stimulus of World War II encouraged postwar policymakers to employ Keynesian fiscal and monetary policies in the place of the microeconomic regulations and reforms utilized during the Progressive Era and New Deal. Recent scholarship has recast this interpretation by linking the embrace of macroeconomic stabilization to the efforts of conservative business groups to dismantle the legacy of the New Deal, especially its support for organized labor. This dissertation challenges these narratives by demonstrating how a prewar policy of raising labor's purchasing power in order to combat depression transformed into a postwar Keynesian solution for inflation known as wage-price policy, which called for restraining wages in order to stabilize costs and prices.   During the Progressive Era, economists theorized that firms and unions could exploit their market power to siphon off income for themselves, behavior popularly known as "robbing Peter to pay Paul." Fearing that this scramble for income would result in insufficient purchasing power to sustain employment, economists proposed to boost demand at its source through a wage-price policy under which wages rose at the same rate as did national labor productivity. The postwar "Keynesian Consensus" rendered this use of wage-price policy obsolete by demonstrating that the government could maintain demand directly through fiscal and monetary stimulus, but it also described how the market power of firms and unions could take advantage of these macroeconomic policies to create a "cost-push" inflation. The Consensus concluded that wages must now be held to the limit of productivity so that the government could pursue full employment without having to tolerate cost-push inflation.   Importantly, this dissertation argues that wage-price policy initially developed as the business community sought to adapt the New Deal order to the postwar economic climate. Historians working in the records of unions and business associations have recently interpreted developments in labor relations during this period as evidence of a conservative counter-offensive against the New Deal. This dissertation challenges this analysis of postwar corporate conservatism through case studies of three leading industries: motor vehicles, electrical equipment, and steel. By drawing upon never before cited corporate records from firms including Ford Motors, General Motors, General Electric, and U.S. Steel, this dissertation exposes how the leading firms of the core industrial economy collaborated with economists and one another in order to repurpose the adversarial system of labor relations envisioned by the New Deal into the basis of a non-inflationary wage-price policy. By reconstructing collective bargaining negotiations around new measures of productivity, firms hoped to contain their labor costs and so meet their financial and competitive objectives without having to wage an uphill political battle against organized labor.   At first, the federal government looked favorably on voluntary private efforts to combat cost-push inflation, limiting its direct interventions outside of wartime to generalized exhortations for restraint and private statesmanship. By the late 1950s, however, the Keynesian Consensus had concluded that the government would inevitably face a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment until it exercised direct control over costs. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, policymakers at the White House, Congress, and even the Federal Reserve transfored the previously voluntary wage-price policy into the basis for federal incomes policies so that the specter of inflation would not distract the government from the pursuit of full employment. For a brief period in the early 1970s, these federal efforts also enjoyed the support of the business sector, which had become convinced that its voluntary efforts at wage-price restraint were no longer effective in the face of a hostile labor climate. With time, however, this reliance on microeconomic control undercut the macroeconomic promises of the Keynesian Consensus as it failed to provide a solution to the misery of stagflation. Only in the 1980s, when the industrial-labor order that had given rise to wage-price policy in the early 20th collapsed, would policymakers recognize that they could fulfill the objectives of the Keynesian Consensus without being held hostage to big business and big labor.},

It follows from the model that if the fiscal stance is not set in the appropriate fashion - that is, at a well-defined level and growth rate - then full employment and low inflation will not be achieved in a sustainable way. We also show that fiscal policy on its own could achieve both full employment and a target rate of inflation. Finally, we arrive at two unconventional conclusions: (1) that an economy (described within an SFC framework) with a real rate of interest net of taxes that exceeds the real growth rate will not generate explosive interest flows, even when the government is not targeting primary surpluses, and (2) that it cannot be assumed that a debtor country requires a trade surplus if interest payments on debt are not to explode. {\textcopyright} 2007 M.E.

abstract = {The article investigates the character of economic and financial crisis management dynamics in the European Union (EU) between 2007 and 2014. In particular, it explores the main actors and imaginaries structuring European governance processes in reaction to the North Atlantic financial crisis. First, a Cultural Political Economy perspective on power and discourse is developed by drawing on concepts from Neo-Gramscian International Political Economy and Critical Discourse Analysis. Second, concrete EU policy reactions to the crisis are distinguished into three main policy fields of crisis management, with each being examined in terms of the dominant economic forces, policy discourses and political actors that shape them. The article shows that pre-crisis modes of accumulation and regulation of the European economy have been broadly maintained and even sharpened by the crises in Europe. This consolidated reproduction is especially fostered by the evolutionary interplay of dominant transnational social forces from European export- and finance-oriented industries as well as of the established economic imaginary of competitiveness on the EU level. As such, the article argues for a rediscovery of transnational dynamics in European studies of the crisis as these dynamics play a crucial role in coordinating spatial, temporal and institutional varieties in European reactions to the crisis.},

The two small open economies share similarities in that both countries had capital inflows before the crisis, ending with a sudden stop. However, the mechanisms of the crisis, which induced the capital flows, the factors that influenced them and their effects on the real economy differed due to differences in currency regimes and the response to the crises. We investigate the link between financialisation and the transmission channels of financialisation on the macroeconomy, using ARDL methodology. Finally, we suggest policy prescriptions to limit the scale and scope of similar crises in the future while highlighting the institutional differences between the two economies.

Shareholder value orientation is reflected by a high dividend payout ratio applied by firms and the reluctance of firms to finance physical investment via new equity issues. Financialisation is the more general development towards an increased importance of the financial sector of the economy relative to the non-financial sector. In this article, a synthetic, stock-flow consistent model is developed that attempts to encompass some important recent works on the effects of financialisation. This includes contributions from the fields of mainstream information economics and post-Keynesian economics. We conduct simulations reflecting increased shareholder value orientation, and show that the results are consistent with important stylised facts.]},

abstract = {An examination is made of theories of household saving.  J.  Maynard Keynes' (1936) list of 8 motives for saving, along with an additional "down payment" motive, are recognized as complete.  There is considerable heterogeneity in the motives for saving.  It is unlikely that a single explanation will suffice for all members of a population at a given time or even for the same person over a long stretch of time.  In particular, there is a widespread feeling that the wealthy have different motives to save from the less wealthy.  In addition, many of the motives are complementary.  There are some motives that will lead to behavior that will be difficult to rationalize with traditional economic models.  Theory and facts concerning saving are presented.  There is a sharp dichotomy in the saving literature between the two.  The principal innovation in the standard theory in the past decade has been to allow for the precautionary motive.  The certainty-equivalence model, the standard additive model, the Euler Equation for intertemporal allocation, and liquidity constraints and habits are examined in detail.},

Less attention has been paid, however, to the diverging current account balances of the individual euro area countries. In this paper we consider the dynamics of current account adjustment and the role of real exchange rates in current account determination in the EMU countries. After controlling for the effects of income growth, we find the relationship between real exchange rates and current accounts to be substantial in size and subject to nonlinear effects. We find that real exchange rates can offer further insights, beyond the effects of the income catch-up process, relevant to current account determination in the EMU. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The recent instability in financial markets demonstrated the inadequacy of the mainstream treatment of money and the underlying production base. This has stimulated interest in the possible role of a money commodity. The fundamental function of monetary theory, an explanation of the general level of prices, is provided through only two analytical mechanisms, quantity-based valueless money or a money commodity. The quantity-based explanation is unsound by its own logic. The theoretical argument for commodity-based money, on the other hand, is analytically consistent. This theoretical superiority has little practical impact because the commodity money hypothesis is considered empirically absurd. However, a link between gold and aggregate prices in the United States since the end of World War II can be demonstrated, and this link has prima facie  credibility. This credibility might motivate Marxists and other critics of mainstream economics to give serious consideration to commodity-based monetary theory. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

the relationship between stock markets with low returns and high

Since at least some models containing money improve the inflation forecasts in certain periods, we argue that money still serves as a useful cross-check for monetary policy analysis.},

Using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with housing, this paper shows that strong monetary reactions to accelerator mechanisms that push up credit growth and house prices can help macroeconomic stability. In addition, using a macroprudential instrument specifically designed to dampen credit market cycles would also provide stabilization benefits when an economy faces financial sector or housing demand shocks. However, the optimal macroprudential rule under productivity shocks is to not intervene. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the source of house price booms for the design of monetary and macroprudential policy.},

abstract = {The paper discusses the interactions of changes in income distribution and the accumulation dynamics in the post-Fordist accumulation regime in OECD countries, which is characterized by deregulated financial markets. The neoliberal mode of regulation came with a decisive shift in power relations at the expense of labor, which is clearly reflected in the fall of wage shares across OECD economies. The notion of a "finance-dominated" accumulation regime is proposed to highlight that financial developments crucially shape the pattern and the pace of accumulation. Financial globalization has relaxed balance of payment constraints and thereby allowed the build up of big international imbalances. The combination of real wage moderation and financial liberalization has led to different strategies (or at least outcomes) in different countries. While some countries (like the USA) exhibit a credit-fuelled consumption-driven growth model that comes with large current account deficits, others (like Germany and Japan) show an export-driven growth model with modest consumption growth and large current account surpluses. Overall the finance-dominated accumulation regime is characterized by a mediocre growth performance and by a high degree of fragility. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

provided by governments in high-income countries represent a
misalignment on emissions' reduction with the global climate agenda. In
addition, a discussion emerged on the negative socio-economic and
environmental externalities associated with fossil fuel subsidies.
Nevertheless, pathways for phasing out fossil fuel subsidies in high
income countries and their implications on the low-carbon transition
have not yet been assessed. With the aim to narrow this knowledge gap,
we extend the EIRIN Stock-Flow Consistent behavioral model to study the
implications on sustainable development of the gradual phasing out of
fossil fuels subsidies, whose revenues could be used by the government
to subsidize energy investments in green capital (e.g. solar panels),
either via fiscal policies or green bonds. We assess the effects on
green growth, employment, credit and bonds market, as well as the
distributive effects across heterogeneous households and sectors. A
smooth phasing out of fossil fuels subsidies contributes to improve
macroeconomic performance, to decrease inequality and helps the
government to find fiscal space to support stable renewable energy
policies. Renewable energy subsidies contribute to foster the low-carbon
transition but could imply distributive effects, depending on the way in
which they are implemented.},

abstract = {The prevailing view among securities regulation scholars is that compensating victims of secondary market securities fraud is inefficient. As the theory goes, diversified investors are as likely to be on the gaining side of a transaction tainted by fraud as the losing side. Therefore, such investors should have no expected net losses from fraud because their expected losses will be matched by expected gains. This Article argues that this view is flawed; even diversified investors can suffer substantial losses from fraud, presenting a compelling case for compensation. The interest in compensation, however, should be advanced by better means than are currently in place. The present system relies on securities class action lawsuits to compensate victims, but these suits not only undercompensate victims, but also underdeter fraud. To improve compensation and better deter fraud, this Article explores the creation of an investor compensation fund. Under this proposal, when a share of stock is sold in the secondary market, a fee, payable by the selling shareholder, will be placed into a fund for fraud victim restitution. The size of the fee will vary by the fraud risk rating assigned to the firm whose stock is sold and, naturally, will affect that stock's trading price. Therefore, firms will have incentives to institute corporate governance practices that minimize the likelihood of fraud. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The Euro Treasury could fulfill a number of additional purposes while operating mainly on the basis of a strict rule.

Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology draws on a "financialization" market construct and adapts it to include the public-private interfaces (PPIs) that have appeared since the global economic crisis. Findings - The crisis has turned the global system on a dime. The decades-long surge of globalization, as characterized by market liberalization and ever more fast-paced investment flows, has abated and, in some cases, been dramatically reversed. It has altered the international investment paradigm. Firms have revised their risk functions and are re-arranging their stakeholder relationships. Research limitations/implications - Much needs to be done to assess the wide-ranging implications of the most recent crisis. This is just one set of "snapshots", if you will, of the way in which market structure and competition are being altered. Originality/value - The re-arrangement of stakeholder relationships of both privately owned firms and sovereign enterprises will have far-reaching effects on market structure in such areas as market access and competition, as well as on civil society, writ large.},

@article{Knyght2011,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to highlight the serious limitations of neo-liberal capitalism and urge for a shift to socialized capital before further economic deterioration leads to a succession of global conflicts. This conceptual paper adopts a macro perspective in presenting argument on how global, financial markets integration and capital flow liberalization have led to inadequate market and corporate governance measures. The argument is couched in a selected literature and is preceded by a proposed solution - the requirement for socialized capital. An analysis of the nature of socialized capital is outlined and the questions that require attention identified if a paradigm shift from neo-liberal capitalism is to take place. The need to urgently shift to a new philosophy of capitalism is overwhelming. Emphasized is that capital needs to adopt a socialised identity and is supported by investment horizons of 30 years or more. It is argued that non-market (e.g. state, NGOs, civil society) intervention is critical in setting appropriate frameworks within which socialized capital can operate. This is a theoretical paper, in which questions are raised which require transparent, public debate. The paper presents the case for a fundamental reconsideration of present day markets, the role of capital and the influence of elites in determining the public good.},

abstract = {One aspect of increased financialization in high-income industrialized countries is the growth and entrenchment of household debt. The debt borne by working-class households in Canada and the United States has risen in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This debt has opened a channel through which value created in the non-financial sector is transferred to financial firms, thereby enhancing the profitability of the financial sector itself while simultaneously raising the rate of exploitation of labor. These developments have profound implications for macroeconomic growth and capital accumulation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {This paper investigates the empirical and theoretical basis of the decoupling between energy throughput and economic growth, with a critical view of the use of the decoupling concept as a policy priority. We provide an analysis of the historical trends of the metabolic pattern of European economies over a period of 18 years focusing on the changes in energy throughput and financial assets. The results show that energy consumption per hour of labor has remained constant, suggesting that no significant changes in production processes or technology have taken place in the productive sectors of the economy. The contribution of this paper is to establish a bridge between the economic analysis of financialization and the societal metabolism analysis of the economic process from a biophysical point of view. We argue that this bridge is crucial to draw attention to the biophysical consequences of financialization (a relative decoupling) and critically assess the pertinence of policies aimed at encouraging the decoupling in the context of increasing inequality.},

We study the dynamics of the model by means of computer simulation. Some macroeconomic properties emerge such as endogenous business cycles, nominal GDP growth, unemployment rate fluctuations, the Phillips curve, leverage cycles and credit constraints, bank defaults and financial instability, and the importance of government as an acyclical sector which stabilize the economy. The model highlights that even extended crises can endogenously emerge. In these cases, the system may remain trapped in a large unemployment status, without the possibility to quickly recover unless an exogenous intervention takes place. {\textcopyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

While both constrained and unconstrained firms may be willing to absorb all the directed credit that they can get (because it may be cheaper than other sources of credit), constrained firms will use it to expand production, while unconstrained firms will primarily use it as a substitute for other borrowing. We apply these observations to firms in India that became eligible for directed credit as a result of a policy change in 1998, and lost eligibility as a result of the reversal of this reform in 2000, and to smaller firms that were already eligible for the preferential credit before 1998 and remained eligible in 2000. Comparing the trends in the sales and the profits of these two groups of firms, we show that there is no evidence that directed credit is being used as a substitute for other forms of credit. Instead, the credit was used to finance more production–there},

We show that Europe does not conform to this paradigm. In the European experience of financial integration, capital has flown from rich to poor countries, and such inflows have been associated with significant acceleration of income convergence. Analysing broader samples of countries, we find that 'downhill' capital flows tend to be observed above certain thresholds in institutional quality and financial integration. But Europe remains different even when allowing for such threshold effects, and its experience is similar to that of interstate flows within the United States. Our findings are consistent with the notion that financial diversification reduces countries' incentives to save in order to self-insure against specific shocks.},

Once a popular method of financing the mortgage and consumer credit markets, aspects of the global securitization market are now struggling to revive. In this paper, I discuss the role that ethics played in securitization prior to the 2008 financial crisis and find that it is not an obvious story of moral failures, but rather that it lies in more subtle elements of the financial system. The ethics uncertainty role in the securitization story is one of flawed incentives and the shifting of responsibility for handling risk. The role of securitization and the ethics of risk transfer have rarely been discussed explicitly in the literature. The historical origins of securitization and lessons learned from previous flawed uses of the process are also provided. I also detail the various global institutional reform proposals that have taken place. Moving forward, it is crucial to understand the causes, consequences, and ethical implications of securitization in the financial crisis so as to help individuals and managers better assess risk, align incentives, and design appropriate policy responses.},

abstract = {By synthesizing stock-flow consistent models, input–output models, and aspects of ecological macroeconomics, a method is developed to simultaneously model monetary flows through the financial system, flows of produced goods and services through the real economy, and flows of physical materials through the natural environment. This paper highlights the linkages between the physical environment and the economic system by emphasizing the role of the energy industry. A conceptual model is developed in general form with an arbitrary number of sectors, while emphasizing connections with the agent-based, econophysics, and complexity economics literature. First, we use the model to challenge claims that 0{\%} interest rates are a necessary condition for a stationary economy and conduct a stability analysis within the parameter space of interest rates and consumption parameters of an economy in stock-flow equilibrium. Second, we analyze the role of energy price shocks in contributing to recessions, incorporating several propagation and amplification mechanisms.

abstract = {Using a "crisis management index" to rank the combined GDP and labour market performances of the EU's 27 Member States, the author considers why some countries performed better than others in managing the economic crisis over the period 2007-11. Based on empirical correlations and regression analysis, he concludes that the best performers share a coordinated market economy model: they feature a mix of economic policies and social institutions - including coordination mechanisms and tighter financial regulation - which helped to stabilize their levels of consumption and aggregate demand. Moreover, they do not have flexible labour markets and thus managed to maintain stable employment levels. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {The emergence of a vast "shadow" financial sector meant that many areas of finance across the globe were unregulated and accumulation of harmful risk was undetected.2 In response, new approaches have been considered and adopted in countries across the world with the key aim of providing regulators with the appropriate tools to detect and mitigate the build-up of systemic risk.3 Whilst much of the reform focus aimed at addressing these problems has been on improving substantive rules,4 there has also been recognition that regulatory weaknesses failed to mitigate the effects of the crisis.5 This has led to a renewed emphasis on improving the regulatory frameworks of many financial systems.6 In particular, there has been a push for an improvement of the institutional environment that supports the role of regulators in acting when most needed.7 This reform program has been spurred on by the perceived failure of many forms of financial regulatory framework in preventing the problems that led to the GFC.8 Although the apparent poor performance of these frameworks has lent support to theories asserting that the particular form of regulatory institutional infrastructure has little to do with the ability of states to prevent or mitigate the effects of financial catastrophe,9 it is generally accepted that institutional design remains integral in combating financial crises.10 Support for the continued importance of institutional design in financial stability has often looked to the relatively positive performance during the GFC of some countries, including Australia," using the so-called Twin Peaks model of financial infrastructure ("Twin Peaks Model").12 This has led several countries hardest hit by the GFC to consider adopting various forms of the Twin Peaks Model when introducing their own reforms, in the hope that this would address some of the regulatory concerns identified during the GFC.13 Australian reformers, relying on positive analysis of the Twin Peaks Model, have been less inclined to engage in a review that would disturb the current status quo for fear of negatively altering what has generally been considered an important factor in Australia's relative successful navigation of the GFC.14 But, whilst the Australian financial regulatory framework surely deserves some of the praise that it has received, Australian reformers should continue to explore potential improvements to the financial regulatory system to ensure that the system will be best positioned to meet the challenges of the evolving financial system.15 In this regard, several improvements in the regulatory framework have been suggested by the recent Financial System Inquiry in Australia (FSI)16 and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its assessment of Australia.17 But, these recommendations were made with little reference to the way in which the Australian financial regulatory framework had coped in the past with financial crises and challenges in Australia.18 Viewing the framework through an historic lens may help Australia avoid a repeat of the series of corporate collapses in the early 2000s that followed many years of sustained growth in Australia and Australia's strong performance during the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s.19 This has become an increasingly important task in light of the interconnected nature of modern day global finance, where risks are likely to emanate from a multitude of sources that are difficult to identify.20 As a consequence, regulators across the world have been given a more prominent role when it comes to detecting and mitigating systemic risk.21 This paper examines how the Twin Peaks Model in Australia has responded to financial collapses and challenges since its implementation.22 Although isolated corporate collapses do not necessarily indicate regulatory failure,23 it is useful, in light of the wholesale rethink that is taking place after an event such as the GFC and the increased move towards some form of the Twin Peaks Model of regulation internationally in response to the GFC, to consider whether these experiences suggest ongoing regulatory challenges.24 By exploring these common themes in financial regulation by reference to various financial collapses and challenges, we provide an indication of where, even in the absence of a major financial crisis,25 Australia might focus its reform agenda and improve the current financial regulatory framework.},

abstract = {This paper contributes to the debate on what economics can learn from the credit crisis and recession. It asks what are the elements in the mainstream paradigm that caused many economists to misjudge the state of the economy so dramatically in the years leading up to the 2007 credit crisis and the 2008-2009 recession. It scrutinizes the work of twelve economists who warned of the crisis and identifies, as the common elements in their thinking, financial assets, debt, the flow of funds and behavioral assumptions on uncertainty, bounded rationality and non-optimizing behavior. These are then contrasted to mainstream thinking. The conclusion is that economics, if it is to be relevant to reality, should stop neglecting money, wealth and debt, and turn away from an individualistic view and toward a systemic view of the economy.

abstract = {These essays consider why a benevolent monetary authority faced with an exploitable asset price channel might implement overly loose monetary policy, and they explore potential unintended consequences arising from a persistent regime of low real interest rates and high asset prices. In the first essay, I propose a general equilibrium model of monetary policy in which the monetary authority faces an exploitable asset price channel but also a time consistency problem. The model predicts that the monetary authority implements sub-optimally loose policy, leading to a socially excessive degree of financial instability, consistent with recent critiques of the Federal Reserve's unconventional policies since 2009.    The second essay slightly revises the model to investigate how exogenous variation in the risk-free real interest rate and asset prices influences capital accumulation, private sector indebtedness, the size of the financial sector, bank system loan losses, and the evolution of wealth inequality across households. I argue that high asset prices induced by a persistent policy regime of very low real interest rates give rise to growing private sector indebtedness, a larger “high finance” sector, a higher loan loss ratio in the banking system, and greater wealth disparities. I argue, further, that the effect of variation in asset prices on capital investment, while generally positive, attenuates at high asset valuation levels, and that higher asset prices can become counter-productive in stimulating investment when asset market valuations are sufficiently high. The third essay presents a variety of evidence from advanced economies between 1960 and 2015, with results generally consistent with the theoretical predictions of the second essay.},

abstract = {This paper advances three fundamental propositions regarding money: (1) As R. W. Clower (1965) famously put it, money buys goods and goods buy money, but goods do not buy goods. (2) Money is always debt; it cannot be a commodity from the first proposition because, if it were, that would mean that a particular good is buying goods. (3) Default on debt is possible. These three propositions are used to build a theory of money that is linked to common themes in the heterodox literature on money. The approach taken here is integrated with Hyman Minsky's (1986) work (which relies heavily on the work of his dissertation adviser, Joseph Schumpeter [1934]); the endogenous money approach of Basil Moore; the French-Italian circuit approach; Paul Davidson's (1978) interpretation of John Maynard Keynes, which relies on uncertainty; Wynne Godley's approach, which relies on accounting identities; the “K” distribution theory of Keynes, Michal Kalecki, Nicholas Kaldor, and Kenneth Boulding; the sociological approach of Ingham; and the chartalist, or state money, approach (A. M. Innes, G. F. Knapp, and Charles Goodhart). Hence, this paper takes a somewhat different route to develop the more typical heterodox conclusions about money.},

abstract = {The accommodative non-standard monetary policy measures taken by the Eurosystem in response to the nancial and sovereign debt crisis caused the reserves of (commercial) banks in the euro area to increase sharply. In spite of this, the annual growth rate of the monetary aggregate M3 has remained at a moderate level over the past two years, reigniting interest in the connection between the creation of reserves and growth in the broader monetary aggregate. It su ces to look at the creation of (book) money as a set of straightforward accounting entries to grasp that money and credit are created as the result of complex interactions between banks, non-banks and the central bank. And a bank's ability to grant loans and create money has noth- ing to do with whether it already has excess reserves or deposits at its disposal. Instead, various economic and regulatory factors constrain the process of money creation. From the perspective of banks, the creation of money is limited by the need for individual banks to lend pro tably and also by micro and macroprudential regulations. Non-banks' demand for credit and portfolio behaviour likewise act to curtail the creation of money. The central bank in uences the money and credit creation process in normal times through its interest rate policy, which affects the nancing and portfolio decisions of banks and non-banks through various transmission channels. Non-standard monetary policy measures, too, have effects on the creation of money and credit. One such unconventional measure, the Eurosystem's asset purchase programme, differs from interest rate policy in that it directly boosts the supply of reserves. Moreover, purchase pro- grammes structured in this manner have an immediate expansionary impact (originating directly from the asset purchase) on the stock of money held by non-banks, though this effect is damp- ened in the euro area by the fact that the Eurosystem does not only purchase the assets from domestic non-banks. There are also indirect effects resulting from the transmission of the pur- chase programme and its impact on lending and portfolio allocation. Critics point to the banking system's capacity to create money as one of the main culprits behind destabilising nancial cycles and nancial crises, hence the long-standing debate about pro- posals to fully back deposits with central bank money, a move intended to restrict the extent to which the banking sector can create credit. It is not evident, however, that these constraints do indeed make for a nancial system that is more stable overall than might in any case be achieved through targeted regulatory action. At the same time, that kind of transition to a new system would risk impairing important functions which the banking system performs for the economy and are crucial for keeping real economic growth on a steady path.},

Wall Street made it clear that local brokers and lenders could target any submarket, any community that made sense in a particular urban and regional context-so long as borrowers were delivered to feed the vast securitization machine.85 In the expansion, grabbing market share meant adapting some of the old abuses used to strip wealth from the black inner city to the broader multicultural mosaic of the Sun Belt suburbs-including a growing proportion of Anglo whites.},

abstract = {There has scarcely been a day in the last three years when we have not read depressing headlines in the newspapers about the global economic crisis. The current turmoil, which many experts concur in seeing as the worst jolt to the world economy since the Great Depression, is pushing the parameters of the established system to its limits. One could say that we see, in the short-term measures taken against the crisis at the time, an effective anti-crisis strategy. But ironically, the promptness with which these short-term measures were enacted prevented adequate questioning of the dominant paradigm which had caused the crisis. As a result, the structural problems leading to the crisis were not reduced. Despite the occurrence of the deepest economic crisis to be experienced since the Great Depression, the present economic emergency did not shake the neoclassical economic paradigm as strongly as was needed. A puzzle that this study aims to solve arises here: Why and how has the conventional wisdom survived and reproduced its intellectual hegemony even after the "most devastating economic crisis" since the Great Depression?

abstract = {The term employer of last resort means the government offers employment to anyone who seeks work but would otherwise be without a job. One of the barriers to the achievement of a high level of employment is undoubtedly a lack of sufficient aggregate demand. The provision of sufficient aggregate demand is a necessary though not sufficient condition for the achievement of high levels of employment. There are other barriers to high employment, notably lack of productive capacity, inflation barriers, and balance of trade constraints, as well as political and intellectual constraints. The employer of last resort (ELR) addresses only the issue of insufficient aggregate demand and not the other limitations. Further, it attacks the insufficiency of aggregate demand in a very particular way. There are other ways of tackling the aggregate demand problem, including increases in mainline public expenditure, reduced taxation, and stimulus for investment and of consumption. It has been argued here that these other measures form the basis of securing high levels of aggregate demand. There are well-known difficulties with the fine tuning of aggregate demand, and the measures mentioned may be viewed more in terms of coarse tuning the economy. The ELR proposals could also be viewed in terms of fine tuning to secure high levels of employment, though doubts have been raised above as to whether it would constitute full employment. Full employment and stable prices are the promised outcome. Best of all, according to the taxes drive money view, it is not going to cost us anything. This paper has argued that it does not offer price stability, though it may offer high levels of employment without any greater inflationary pressures than would prevail otherwise. It has also been argued that it may offer work for all, but this would involve significant underemployment and unemployment under another name.},

abstract = {The stock-flow consistent (SFC) modelling approach, grounded in the pioneering work of Wynne Godley and James Tobin in the 1970s, has been adopted by a growing number of researchers in macroeconomics, especially after the publication of Monetary Economics by Godley and Lavoie, which provided a general framework for the analysis of whole economic systems, and the recognition that macroeconomic models integrating real markets with flow-of-funds analysis had been particularly successful in predicting the Great Recession of 2007-2009. We introduce the general features of the SFC approach for a closed economy, showing how the core model has been extended to address issues such as financialization and income distribution. We next discuss the implications of the approach for models of open economies and compare the methodologies adopted in developing SFC empirical models for whole countries. We review the contributions where the SFC approach is being adopted as the macroeconomic closure of microeconomic agent-based models, and how the SFC approach is at the core of new research in ecological macroeconomics. Finally, we discuss the appropriateness of the name 'SFC' for the class of models we survey. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {As baby boomers reach retirement age, concerns over the future path of federal spending on entitlement programs grow among orthodox economists. These economists have developed a measure that they call the "fiscal imbalance" -- which they claim measures the magnitude of an existing unsustainable fiscal path. The "fiscal imbalance" is calculated as the current national debt plus the present value of future expenditures less the present value of future revenues; future expenditures and revenues are estimated or predicted to the infinite horizon. As a modern or sovereign money system operating under flexible exchange rates, interest rates on the US national debt are a matter of political economy. This has significant implications for the appropriate "mix" of monetary and fiscal policies, particularly if full employment and financial stability are considered fundamental goals of macroeconomic policy that can be enhanced by appropriate fiscal policy actions. The sustainability of fiscal policy as determined via the orthodox IGBC framework is irrelevant for understanding the workings of a modern money economy.},

abstract = {Most of the empirical literature on exchange rate regimes uses the IMF de jure classification based on the regime announced by the governments, despite the recognized inconsistencies between reported and actual policies in many cases. To address this problem, we construct a de facto classification based on data on exchange rates and international reserves from all IMF-reporting countries over the period 1974–2000, which we believe provides a meaningful alternative for future empirical work on the topic. The classification sheds new light on several stylized facts previously reported in the literature. In particular, we find that the de facto pegs have remained stable throughout the last decade, although an increasing number of them shy away from an explicit commitment to a fixed regime (“hidden pegs”). We confirm the hollowing out hypothesis but show that it does not apply to countries with limited access to capital markets. We also find that pure floats are associated with only relatively minor nominal exchange rate volatility and that the recent increase in the number of de jure floats goes hand in hand with an increase in the number of de facto dirty floats (“fear of floating”).},

@phdthesis{Goodliffe2008,
abstract = {This dissertation attempts to account for the resurgence of the Far Right in France since the establishment of democracy in the country in the final quarter of the nineteenth Century. Taking to task historical treatments of this political phenomenon for their failure to specify the conditions and dynamics attending its emergence, and faulting the historical myopia of contemporary institutionalist accounts, the dissertation explains the continuing appeal of the Far Right by relating the socio-structural outcomes of French industrialization and democratization to the persistence of an illiberal political culture within French society. Specifically, it argues that, as a result of France's protracted and uneven experience of industrialization and urbanization, significant ‘pre-' or ‘anti-modern' social classes subsisted late into the country's development which remained functionally ill-adapted and culturally ill-disposed to liberal capitalism and democracy. Historically incorporating what have been termed the ‘traditional middle classes' and, more recently, a growing stratum of the working class, these groups progressively turned against the process of capitalist modernization as well as the Republican state that oversaw it. The study concludes that these groups developed an illiberal political worldview or ‘culture' which made them receptive to the authoritarian and xenophobic prescriptions of the Far Right in periods of economic and social crisis.    This study employs a multi-disciplinary approach. At a first level, it draws on the principles of historical sociology in order to situate movements of the French Far Right in their broader social, economic and political contexts, and to specify the cultural dispositions of the social groups who supported them. Second, the dissertation also studies interest group aggregation as well as institutional and electoral processes in order to understand the political dynamics attending the emergence of these movements at particular historical junctures.},

@article{Wray2007,
abstract = {It has long been recognized that Thorstein Veblen and John Maynard Keynes share a common approach to the nature of “business enterprise” or “monetary production” in the modern capitalist economy (Dillard 1948; Dowd 1964). Keynes's most explicit treatment was in the early drafts of the General Theory, unfortunately the final version dropped some of the clearest statements. Veblen's best known exposition was in the Theory of Business Enterprise. This paper will provide a concise summary of Veblen's views on the “credit economy,” comparing that with Keynes's “monetary economy.” While there are many similarities, Veblen's version is in some important respects more complete, and still relevant for developing an understanding of modern business practice. On one hand, this is not surprising as Keynes had let many of the monetary details “fall into the background.” However, as Matthew Wilson (2006) argues, it is surprising that most followers of Keynes have not mined the Theory of Business Enterprise for arguments that nicely complement and extend Keynes's better known approach.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to provide a selective bibliography and examine the potential of the digital technologies, using an inter-disciplinary literature survey that will contribute to academic and practical knowledge with regard to the understanding of the emerging forms of doing business and competition together with their developmental implications. The paper examines a survey of a collection of papers that have been published before and after the new economy bubble. These writings then are classified under two main headings: the views of the (new) digital economy proponents and the sceptics. These two opposing approaches are compared and contrasted through the use of five sub-sections: conceptualisation, driving force, spatial/developmental implications, industrial impacts of the digital economy, epistemological/methodological foundations. The paper finds that claims about the world economy entering into a new phase of a virtuous capitalism or a new international division of labour are over-exaggerated. A more balanced approach should take into consideration both the dynamics of change and continuity without underestimating the future potential of digital technologies. This paper offers a critical assessment of the digital economy, based on an inter-disciplinary literature survey that brings together pieces of work that have previously been analysed largely in a separate manner.},

@article{Barnes2016,
abstract = {Was there really a debt-fuelled 'liberal growth model' that preceded the 2008 financial crisis? The accepted narrative about the pre-crisis boom is that some liberal countries relied on domestic consumption to fuel economic growth, and on household debt to fuel this consumption. In this, they contrasted with coordinated economies. While eventually unsustainable, the growth strategy was politically necessary to maintain middle-class living standards in the context of increasing income inequality. In this article, I take these contentions to the data. Economic evidence from 1995-2007 and political data from the Comparative Manifesto Project Database undermine this received wisdom: while household debt increased in the liberal countries, it does not differentiate this particular growth model. Further, there is no evidence that politicians in liberal countries advocate different economic policies, including those concerning borrowing, to claim credit and stay in power. Differences in the importance of finance between countries, however, suggest a more elite-driven divergence.},

abstract = {This paper presents an investigation of global recovery from the Great Recession and the rebalancing of global external imbalances, using a global model of 16 countries and composite regions. The model applies to the short term and only to the real side. Key features are demand-driven output determination, pro-cyclical aggregate labour productivity, imperfect competition in product markets and simple bargaining in non-clearing labour markets, which together determine the functional distribution of income. Trade is modelled in a bilateral import matrix; particular attention is paid to international adjustment. Simulation results suggest that early exit from fiscal support threatens a fragile recovery. Further, domestic demand expansion and revaluation in real terms in surplus countries are necessary for rebalancing, and a variety of measures can be employed to achieve these goals. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

abstract = {We analyse the relationship between functional income distribution and economic growth in Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA from 1960 until 2005. The analysis is based on a demand-driven distribution and growth model for an open economy inspired by Bhaduri and Marglin, which allows for either profit- or wage-led growth. We find that growth in France, Germany, the UK and the USA has been wage-led, whereas Austria and the Netherlands have been profit-led. In the case of Austria a domestically wage-led economy changes to profit-led when including the effect of distribution on external trade. The Netherlands, however, are already profit-led without external trade. Our results so far only partially confirm Bhaduri and Marglin's theoretical conclusion that wage-led growth becomes less feasible when the effects of distribution on foreign trade are taken into account.

The paper reviews previous investigations of national wealth, compares their estimates with the ones presented here and discusses method approaches and measurement problems. The main results from data series are presented for assets and liabilities and their subcomponents, for the private and public domestic and foreign sectors. By complementing the past literature with its traditional focus on economic flow variables to understand long-run economic developments, this new database offers potentially new perspectives on a number of important issues in Sweden's economic history.},

It analyses empirically the determinants of these risk sources separately, developing a new large dataset compiled from national sources for 33 emerging economies over 1994–2006. The paper finds that economic size, the breadth of the domestic investor base, inflation and fiscal soundness are all associated with risky public domestic debt compositions, yet to an extent that varies considerably in terms of magnitude and significance across sources of risk. Only inflation impacts all types of risky debt, underscoring the overarching importance of monetary credibility to make domestic debt compositions in emerging economies safer. Given local bond markets' rapid development, monitoring risky public domestic debt compositions in emerging economies becomes increasingly relevant to global financial stability.},

abstract = {This paper provides a summary of the OECD's new global macroeconometric
model, including an overview of model structure and a selection of
simulations illustrating its main properties. Compared with its
predecessors, the new model is more compact and regionally aggregated,
but gives more weight to the focus of policy interests in global trade
and financial linkages. The country model structures typically combine
short-term Keynesian-type dynamics with a consistent long-run
neo-classical supply-side. While retaining a conventional treatment of
international trade and payments linkages, the model has a greater
degree of stock-flow consistency, with explicit modelling of domestic
and international assets, liabilities and associated income streams.
Account is also taken of the influence of financial and housing market
developments on asset valuation and domestic expenditures via house and
equity prices, interest rates and exchange rates. As a result, the model
gives more prominence to wealth and wealth effects in determining
longer-term outcomes and the role of asset prices in the transmission of
international shocks both to goods and financial markets. (C) 2010

abstract = {Within the context of a new capitalistic phase of development, some South American countries undertook until recently a search process of an alternative path of development to neoliberalism, or "neo-developmentalism" experiences. In neo-developmentalist countries, the states' inner action was complemented with the use, at the supranational scale, of the states' external power to further a geoeconomic and political realignment with China, Russia, the BRICS and the Global South, and, thus, a distancing from US and its hegemonic system of states. Centered on state action, to which we provide a set of theoretical foundations related to capitalistic phases of development from a Gramscian perspective, we explore neo-developmentalism experiences (particularly Brazil's and Argentina's), their supranational realignment and the possible consequences to multi-polarity, including the recent setbacks suffered by the progressive governments. We conclude that those trends won't avoid China, the BRICS and the Global South to continue reconfiguring South America, but another push like the one recently seen might have to wait until the next expansive phase of the commodity price cycle.},

Private and public R{\&}D spending across three competing, yet
complementary inputs - Labor, Capital, and Resources - follow a

policy experiments are reported; a market-based Resource tax increase,
and a centralized green policy, where public R{\&}D budget is shifted
towards Resource-saving technologies. We highlight that in the presence
of labor market institutions, which give rise to hysteresis, and limited
R{\&}D budgets, a policy of continuous Resource tax growth is needed to
induce Resource-saving technological change to achieve a greener
economy. This needs to be coupled with planned government spending
adjustment to spur demand and boost investment. The findings also
suggest that a mix of market-based and centralized policies may be
optimal.},

Specifically, this paper argues that much of the economic growth over the last two decades can be attributed to the top two quintiles borrowing more and the current slow growth can be attributed to high quintile households increasing their consumption while middle income households are continuing to deleverage.

abstract = {This article explores the decisive role of pension funds in the neoliberal restructuring of the Icelandic economy, arguing that, through their involvement in the pension-fund industry, the labour unions contributed to laying the foundations for Iceland's economic financialisation. The socioeconomic stability provided by the labour organisations was the crucial element upon which the new financial regime of accumulation relied, enhancing the national economic 'credibility' that helped the internal market to attract foreign speculators as well as gaining access to loans from international market. I begin by examining how the structural crisis of the Icelandic economy produced an explosion of inflation and industrial conflict in the late-1980s. I then retrace the way the implementation of a neo-corporatist pattern enabled lower inflation and stabilisation of the currency. Finally, I analyse the way in which the involvement of the Icelandic trade unions in the financial mechanisms through the pension industry generated a degree of identification with pro-market governmental policy on the part of union leaders, encouraging them to tailor their own strategies accordingly. My conclusion is that Icelandic unions' consensus concerning the 'stabilisation programme' implemented by the neoliberal coalitions relies on their embeddedness into the financial structures of the national economy through occupational pension funds.

We rely on a model that features Borrowers and Savers and allows for over-borrowing induced by news-shock-driven cycles. We find that policy that responds to changes in financial variables is socially optimal. Considering the use of a single policy instrument, both types of agents are better off when the interest rate optimally responds to credit growth. When we allow for the implementation of both interest-rate and LTV policies, heterogeneity in the welfare implications is key in determining the optimal use of policy instruments. The optimal policy for the Borrowers is characterized by a LTV ratio that responds countercyclically to credit growth, which most effectively stabilizes credit relative to GDP. In contrast, the optimal policy for the Savers features a constant LTV ratio coupled with an interest-rate response to credit growth. News-shock-driven cycles account for most of the gains from a policy response to changes in financial variables. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper empirically distinguishes between the two main contending explanations for credit cycles. Namely, the bank lending channel and the balance sheet channel. This is done by using unique Danish survey, register, rating, and bank data. The results indicate that the bank lending channel explains most of the changes in credit policy by Danish banks towards small and medium (SME) sized firms. However, the results show that both channels are operational, but the balance sheet channel is surprisingly weak partly because discouragement during the crisis kept struggling firms from applying for credit. The analysis also reveals that the credit supply was weaker in banks that were struggling during the crisis and indirectly that firms could not off-set this effect by changing banks. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that the financial crisis also affected the liquidity of non-financial firms, as credit demand rose immediately following the crisis.},

According to the author, there is a very high probability that the present crisis will become more acute as a systemic crisis of capital, since all the conditions are there for that to happen.

What can explain why countries, such as Ecuador and El Salvador, would voluntarily subjugate themselves completely to another country's monetary regime? Given its dramatic impact on the power of the state, why would any independent country choose to dollarize?     Up until now, scholarly attempts to explain dollarization have focused on its theoretical economic "advantages" and "disadvantages": its impact on lowering interest rates, greater access to credit, the economic benefits of currency stability versus reductions in seigniorage and the loss of monetary sovereignty. In the case of Ecuador, economists and political scientists, alike, agreed that dollarization was the only option available: it was a sheer act of desperation divorced from social or political considerations other than the desperate need for quick stability. However, these answers fall flat, as they ignore 1) the relationship between local struggles over dollarization and financial globalization, 2) the differential ways in which dollarization impacts various societal groups, creating winners and losers with strong interests in influencing policy adoption, and 3) the ways in which internal political struggles and coalitional alliances impact the outcome of these struggles. Differing monetary regimes create concentrated groups of winners and losers and where there are winners and losers, actors will work to impose their preferred policies.    Through detailed case studies of two countries where a campaign for dollarization was successful (Ecuador and El Salvador) and one case study of a country where dollarization was defeated (Argentina), this dissertation shows that struggles over dollarization reflect sectorial distributional struggles that are intrinsically related to processes of financial globalization.},

abstract = {The answer to the question 'what is money?' has changed throughout history. During the Gold Standard era, money was seen as gold or silver (the theory known as bullionism). In the early 20 th century, the alternative theory known as chartalism proposed that money was a token chosen by the state for payment of taxes. Today, many economists take an agnostic line, and argue that money is best defined in terms of its function, e.g. as a neutral medium of exchange. This paper argues that none of these approaches adequately describes the nature of money, and proposes a new theory, inspired by non-Newtonian physics, which takes into account the dualistic real/virtual properties and complex nature of money. The theory is applied to the example of the emergence of cybercurrencies. .},

This paper argues that the expansion may, indeed, continue through 2004 and for some time beyond. But with the government and external deficits both so large and the private sector so heavily indebted, satisfactory growth in the medium term cannot be achieved without a large, sustained and discontinuous increase in net export demand. It is doubtful whether this will happen spontaneously and it certainly will not happen without a cut in domestic absorption of goods and services by the US which would impart a deflationary impulse to the rest of the world. We make no short term forecast. Instead, using a model rooted in a consistent system of stock and flow variables, we trace out a range of possible medium term scenarios in order to evaluate strategic predicaments and policy options without being at all precise about timing.},

In most treatments it is ‘neutral,' as either: a symbolic ‘veil' over an underlying ‘real' economy; a special ‘commodity' with utility for the rational maximizing individual; or as part of a model of aggregate economic ‘variables.' The methodological assumptions of these approaches cannot account for the fundamental characteristics of money as a measure of value and acceptable means of payment. Many of these diffculties are resolved if money is conceptualized as a structure of social relations.

abstract = {Specialized mortgage intermediaries in Denmark have for over 200 years provided owners and buyers of real property wide access to credit. The present paper sets out to explore the safeguards that nurtured development of a robust, market based financing system and a deep mortgage market. Observations are made on the nature of collateral performance in respect to property rights, mortgage law and market development in search of general features of required institutional arrangements. The robustness of the Danish mortgage finance system is largely accredited to the securitization model based on the balance principle that assigns risks and responsibility to market players in a self-disciplinary manner and protected the mortgage banks against cash flow mismatches even during deep crisis, as history attests. It is shown how property registers and effective enforcement have created transparent property rights and practically reduced legal risks of mortgaging to zero. Standardization and scale of economics supported collateral efficiency, as measured in terms of simplicity, transparency, rapidity and costs. The Danish mortgage finance system illustrates the critical role of government in insuring the quality and enforceability of mortgage collateral, and reducing uncertainty for market players throughout the entire process. The paper suggests that sound incentive structures of the securitization model, strong commitment mechanisms and the market mechanisms constituted a complex formula of safeguards that---rather than specific capital coverage requirements---created the preconditions required for a well-functioning mortgage market.},

abstract = {Purpose - The aim of this paper is to contribute to the literature on balance-of-payments-constrained growth by providing an innovative empirical evaluation of a disaggregated version of the so-called Thirlwall's Law derived from a Pasinettian multisectoral framework. Design/methodology/approach - After estimating sectoral elasticities of exports and imports for a considerable panel dataset of 90 countries over the period 1965-1999, the authors have performed two empirical exercises. First, they grouped countries together by income level and evaluated a multisectoral balance-of-payments-constrained growth model by analyzing prediction errors and mean absolute deviations. Second, the authors carried out a regression validity test on the results. Findings - The main findings give support to the validity of the multisectoral version of Thirlwall's Law, providing therefore further understanding of the structural determinants of the uneven international development and guidance for the design of growth-enhancing national structural policies. Originality/value - The main value added of this contribution to the existing literature lies in the use of disaggregated trade data in conjunction with modern panel data econometric techniques to obtain empirical estimates on the balance-of-payments constraints to long-run economic growth for an unprecedently large sample of countries.},

@phdthesis{Gezici2007,
abstract = {This dissertation examines the effects of financial liberalization on investment decisions of manufacturing firms in Turkey, through the channels of liquidity and uncertainty. While the former channel is analyzed in the literature on financing constraints, the latter is left out of the studies investigating investment behavior under liberalization. As suggested by literature on financing constraints, the positive role of liquidity in determination of investment is expected to be eliminated with liberalization, since firms would have better access to capital markets. I argue that with the consideration of heightened instabilities, the expected change in the importance of liquidity may not take place, as investment is impeded by uncertainty.    Based on the results of a qualitative field research project that involved interviewing the managers of manufacturing firms in Turkey, a firm level investment model which contains output, liquidity and uncertainty as the determinants of investment, is developed in the dissertation. I test the validity of the model with a novel unbalanced data set from Turkish economy, comprising 165 manufacturing firms for the period 1985-2003. The econometric estimation technique adopted estimating this dynamic model is Generalized Moment of Methods (GMM). Based on this benchmark, hypotheses regarding the role of internal funds and uncertainty under the impact of financial liberalization are tested by utilizing various aggregate financial deepening indicators. I also identify different effects across the different firm categories of size, export orientation and maturity.    Econometric tests and survey results provide evidence for a negative relationship between firm level investment and uncertainty variables, and a positive relationship with liquidity and sales variables. The negative impact of uncertainty on investment is worsened under financial liberalization due to nonlinearities in investment-uncertainty relationship as suggested by Post Keynesian theory. There is no evidence for a declining importance of liquidity. Overall, results suggest that financial reform policies did not lead to the expected benefits for the investment of real sector firms while producing increased uncertainty that impedes investment further.},

abstract = {In this study we tried to detect the determinants of non-performing loans for a sample of 85 banks in three countries (Italy, Greece and Spain) for the period of 2004-2008. These countries have faced financial problems after the subprime crisis on 2008. The variables used are macroeconomic variables and specific variables to the bank. The macroeconomic variables are included the rate of growth of GDP, unemployment rate and real interest rate with respect to specific variables opted for the return on assets, the change in loans and the loan loss reserves to total loans ratio (LLR/TL). After the application of the method of panel data, we found the problem loans vary negatively with the growth rate of GDP, the profitability of banks' assets and positively with the unemployment rate, the loan loss reserves to total loans and the real interest rate. 1. Introduction The deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio of banks was the main cause of problems in the banking system and in financial crises in developed economies. Indeed, the increase in loan defaults, banking mortgage in the United States, underlines the links between macroeconomic and financial shocks and the relationship between the friction in the credit market and the risk of financial instability. The theme of "non-performing loans" (NPL) has attracted more attention in recent decades. Several studies examined bank failures and find that asset quality is an indicator of insolvency (Demirguc-Kunt, 1989; Barr and Siems, 1994). Banks still have a high level of impaired loans before the bankruptcy. Therefore, the large amount of bad loans in the banking system generally results in a bank failure. The NPL are among the main causes of the problems of economic stagnation. Each impaired loan in the financial sector increases the possibility to lead company to difficulty and unprofitability. The minimization of NPL is a necessary condition for improving economic growth. When NPL retained permanently, these will have an impact on the resources that are enclosed in unprofitable areas. Thus, NPL are likely to hamper economic growth and reduce the economic efficiency (Hou, 2007). The shocks to the financial system can arise from factors specific to the company (idiosyncratic shocks) or macroeconomic imbalances (systemic shocks). In general, the researches adopted in the developed economies have confirmed that macroeconomic conditions affect credit risk. Initially, this study proposes to know the factors that explain the quality of loans granted by the bank, specifically bad debts. These factors may include macroeconomic and bank-specific variables. The rest of this paper is arranged as follows: the second section discusses the existing literature on the determinants of NPL namely macroeconomic and bank-specific variables and the effect on the quality of loans. The third section describes the data used and the methodology. The fourth section interprets and analyzes the empirical results. Finally, the conclusion will be the fifth section.},

Because this 'financialization' distributes costs and benefits unevenly across groups, politics and policy likely affect the process. Therefore, this article discusses how changes in the power of organizations representing the 'winners' and 'losers' of financialization affect its pace. An analysis of the United States from 1949-2005, shows that when unions are stronger, and when the Democratic Party is in power and is more reliant on the support of working-class voters, financialization is slower. In contrast, when the financial industry is more highly mobilized into politics, financialization is faster. The study also finds that financial deregulation was one policy translating the political power of these actors into economic outcomes.},

We examine the macroeconomic effects of the current IMF-led austerity programme driven by the objective of attaining primary fiscal surpluses and illustrate the ruinous effects of constrained human capital investments due to insufficient funds to public education, and constrained real production activities due to the current mode of financing of domestic debt. We then examine various taxation alternatives to mitigate the reductions in the availability of public funds to reproducible factors of production. Our results suggest that the current fiscal programme based on the primary surplus objective suffers from serious trade-offs on growth and fiscal targets, and that an alternative public expenditures programme with the objective of reviving public funds for education and for social infrastructure is likely to produce superior economic performance.

abstract = {ABSTRACTThis article provides historical account of wealth accumulation and composition in Sweden during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A detailed account on capital formation during the industrialisation process shows that produced capital grew faster than natural capital from the 1850s. Natural capital was changing from a predominance of forest towards crop land as the main asset in the early twentieth century. Produced capital was largely bounded in the agriculture sector up till the second half of the nineteenth century. Heavy investments in the infrastructure sector and later in the manufacturing section changed the produced capital structure and thereby lowered transport costs and return of investment in manufacturing and services; providing incentives for accumulating the stock of produced capital and enhance consumption and living standard. The return on capital was dispersed from the outset of the period but has converged over time.},

abstract = {In this article, I study the impact of financialization on the rise in inequality in 18 OECD countries from 1970 to 2011 and measure the respective roles of various forms of financialization: the growth of the financial sector; the growth of one of its subcomponents, financial markets; the financialization of non-financial firms; and the financialization of households. I test these impacts using cross-country panel regressions in OECD countries. I show first that the share of the finance sector within the GDP is a substantial driver of world inequality, explaining between 20 and 40 percent of its increase from 1980 to 2007. When I decompose this financial sector effect, I find that this evolution was mainly driven by the increase in the volume of stocks traded in national stock exchanges and by the volume of shares held as assets in banks' balance sheets. By contrast, the financialization of non-financial firms and of households does not play a substantial role. Based on this inequality test, I therefore interpret financialization as being mainly a phenomenon of marketization, redefined as the growing amount of social energy devoted to the trade of financial instruments on financial markets.},

The model implicitly assumes that disbursements via interest payments on bonds somehow ensure that all profits are disbursed. But the two are generally different. Forcing them to match renders the model mathematically inconsistent. Alternately, distinguishing the two rectifies the inconsistency but destroys the dichotomy between real and nominal variables and dramatically alter the model's outcomes. One striking consequence is that a rise in the money supply can lead to a fall in prices.},

@article{Montgomerie2016a,
abstract = {Austerity is a key organising concept governing the British political economy since the 2008 financial crisis, it is our present with a future that is still unfolding. As such the outcomes of Austerity are not yet fully known. As such, this paper argues that Austerity is an experiment in economic storytelling that seeks to cope with the post-crash British economy by trying to revive and consolidate the Anglo-American financialised growth model, and, by doing so, actively prevents the necessary structural economic reforms needed to achieve the desired revitalising of the economy. The first section brings into dialogue the structural accounts that explain why Austerity is the outcome of the 2008 financial crisis with the everyday understandings of how Austerity is made through processes by forging common-sense narratives of economic crisis. These accounts are refracted through a feminist political economy lens that is attuned to the dynamics of power – or who must pay the costs of Austerity. The second section details ‘the debt story' in terms of what is told, but also untold, about the UK's alleged debt crisis. The next section focuses on the household to make visible how Austerity crafts political states of intervention and exception that directly inhibit economic change or reform of financialisation. Finally, the paper concludes by considering what feminist-inspired analysis of household can reveal about the fundamental flaws of financialisation under the auspices of Austerity – that debts are both public and private at the same time, transforming the household sector into the ultimate guarantor of continued financialised expansion.},

This paper investigates the effects of housing-related tax policy measures on macroeconomic aggregates using a dynamic general-equilibrium model featuring borrowing and lending across heterogeneous households, financial frictions in the form of collateral constraints tied to house prices, and a rental housing market alongside owner-occupied housing. We analyze the effects of various tax policies and find that they all lead to significant output losses, with large long-run tax multipliers of around 2. Among them, reducing the mortgage interest deduction is the most effective in raising tax revenue per unit of output lost, whereas reducing the depreciation allowance for rental income is the least effective.},

abstract = {Abstract              In the discussion on the causes of the financial crisis three main lines of argument can be distinguished: The "regulatory failure" argument, the theory of the cyclical instability of financial markets, and analyses of "financialization". From a sociological point of view, the latter analyses deserve particular interest, as they consider the crisis in the context of the larger structural changes of mature capitalist societies that have developed since the last decades of the 20th century. The paper first provides an overview of the financialization literature, focussing of the interplay between the changes on the macro-, meso- and micro levels of society that led to the present dominance of the financial services sector over the economy. Moreover, the historical analyses of Arrighi and Silver are considered. The second part of the paper offers a theoretical reconceptualization of the empirical findings in the framework of a multilevel model of capitalist dynamics. The model shows how a prosperous capitalist economy like the Western one in the second half of the 20th century can be transformed into a financialized economy due to its own internal dynamics. From a sociological perspective, financialization can thus be understood as a hegemonial regime of financial investors over entrepreneurs. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

In particular, financial markets and institutions have an increasing influence in the operation of the real economy. In order to look beyond the crisis and create a financial system which is sustainable and which serves the real economy more effectively, it is imperative to understand the imbalances that financial developments have created in terms of enterprises, jobs and incomes. The purpose of this chapter is to assess these imbalances and their implications for the world of work. Section A introduces the concept of "financialization" of the economy and examines how the role of the financial sector has expanded disproportionately in relation to the non-financial sector. Section B examines how financial objectives have been implemented progressively within the non-financial sector itself and the implications of this trend for the world of work.},

abstract = {This article moves beyond current controversies on the nature of money by suggesting that a general social process allows different kinds of organizations and networks-from states to banks to local communities-to produce currencies: that is, the articulation of criteria of creditworthiness, or what I call the exercise of moral authority. Bankers specialize in moral authority, but when that authority is contested, challenging groups must articulate alternative criteria of creditworthiness for their currencies to become stable and acceptable. I illustrate these processes with historical material from the postbellum United States, which I use to discuss why the federal government failed to create a stable financial system, and why local bankers engaged in a process of financial innovation that further destabilized money. I conclude with reflections on the shifting structural sources of moral authority, which have made the local level a springboard for destabilizing financial innovations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The authors argue that the low size of the public expenditures, the adoption of a procyclical expansionary fiscal policy the years before the crisis, and the lack of a correct coordination between the Spanish fiscal policy and the ECB's monetary policy, are key elements to understand the depth and length of the economic crisis and the current high fiscal imbalances in Spain.

abstract = {Drawing on monetary circuit theory, this study develops an approach to analyze the integrated functions of banking and finance in a monetary production economy. The study proposes a micro-founded, circuit-sequenced model of a decentralized-decisions economy, where production, exchange, and investment from households and firms are integrated through money creation and funds allocation operated, respectively, by banks and non-bank financial intermediaries. The model is used to draw implications on: the special nature of banks and the role of non-bank financial intermediaries; the relationship between saving and investment; and the channels through which finance may cause the circuit process to break down. The study also discusses how the circuit approach can be used for an integrated analysis of economic and financial structural change.},

As it turns out, it seems to have played a major role in fueling the dynamics of the subprime mortgage crisis.

The focus is what, inter alia, is lost in this aggregation, namely, the essentially financial role of lenders and their crucial influence, as a matter both of analysis and historical record, on the gearing decision.  The broad argument is that lenders' preferences set upper and lower bound to the gearing levels.  The upper limit is directly imposed by lenders.  Firms are therefore encouraged to take on debt and in fact set target debt ratios within the bounds determined by lenders' behavior.  The larger part of the discussion is devoted to establishing the theoretical case for the existence of the postulated upper bound to the gearing ratio.},

the effects of climate change on financial stability and (ii) the
financial and global warming implications of a green quantitative easing
(QE) programme. Emphasis is placed on the impact of climate change
damages on the price of financial assets and the financial position of
firms and banks. The model is estimated and calibrated using global data
and simulations are conducted for the period 2016-2120. Four key results
arise. First, by destroying the capital of firms and reducing their
profitability, climate change is likely to gradually deteriorate the
liquidity of firms, leading to a higher rate of default that could harm
both the financial and the non-financial corporate sector. Second,
climate change damages can lead to a portfolio reallocation that can
cause a gradual decline in the price of corporate bonds. Third,
climate-induced financial instability might adversely affect credit
expansion, exacerbating the negative impact of climate change on
economic activity. Fourth, the implementation of a green corporate QE
programme can reduce climate-induced financial instability and restrict
global warming. The effectiveness of this programme depends positively
on the responsiveness of green investment to changes in bond yields.},

Estimation results based on this measure of fiscal policy changes suggest that a 1 percent of GDP fiscal consolidation raises the current account balance-to-GDP ratio by about 0.6 percentage point, supporting the twin deficits hypothesis. This effect is substantially larger than that obtained using standard measures of the fiscal policy stance, such as the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance.},

abstract = {The high saving of developing Asian economies has attracted attention of the researchers and policy makers alike. While various country-specific papers have investigated this issue, the present paper looks into this subject in a panel setting discerning the common variables influencing the saving behaviour in developing Asian economies. In particular, the saving behavior of six high saving countries in developing Asia, viz., China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, have been probed in a panel-data framework over the period 1990 through 2007. Specifically, two questions are examined: (a) Does developing Asia save more? and (b) What are the determinants of Asian savings? In the present study, answer to the first question emerges as affirmative from the stylized facts. Furthermore, factors such as high growth, low age-dependency, increasing degree of financial deepening, presence of liquidity constraint, remittances, terms of trade shock and human capital formation emerge as key determinants of savings from the econometric analysis of this panel of six countries. Thus, it seems that the high savings of developing Asian nations can be explained in terms of these standard variables. This has important implications for the way ahead and policy options for resolving global imbalances. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

studies, a surprisingly wide range of numerical values can be found. The
paper discusses quarterly US data that are publicly available where, in
order to capture depreciation, the construction of the capital stock by
the perpetual inventory method relies on detailed estimates of its
lifetime. Subsequently the paper builds up a capital stock series by
alternatively having recourse to the statistics about capital
consumption and furthermore determining an initial level by an
assumption about the long-term growth of capital. This procedure leads
to somewhat different results. In addition, the rates of depreciation
and profit are studied that are implied by the two approaches. The paper
closes with two numerical proposals for the steady state values of these
variables and the output-capital ratio that could be readily employed
for macrodynamic modelling, and that are quite different from many of
the aforementioned examples.},

Being a systemic characteristic, financial stability requires a systemic analysis, which only macroeconomics can offer logically. Yet, the current way of doing macroeconomics is not up to the task, as it is grounded on so-called microfoundations. Considering macroeconomics as the science of aggregating data obtained at microeconomic level can lead indeed to conclusions that are either misleading or wrong. This paper points out that the true foundations of macroeconomics are macroeconomic, and that understanding the working of monetary economies of production and exchange requires a conceptual rather than a mathematical treatment of economic issues at a systemic level.

abstract = {In contemporary research, it is common to measure growth-enhancing financial development by the volume of credit as a ratio of the gross domestic product (GDP), an application of Schumpeter's theory of credit and development. Recently, researchers have been surprised to find a negative relation between this measure and economic growth. This paper has three aims. First, Schumpeter sharply distinguished between the volume of credit financing development and the (typically larger) volume of the secondary wave of credit financing consumption, over-investment and speculation, which follows the primary wave of credit financing innovations. Combined with circuit theory, this helps explain the growth and the effects of credit/GDP ratios in our time. Second, it is shown that an increase in the credit/GDP ratio is due to an increase in secondary wave credit, not productive credit; and since credit is debt, growth in the credit/GDP ratio is negative, not positive for economic development. Third, five contemporary ways in which the use of credit for consumption, financial investment and speculation has been institutionalized are discussed. The message of this paper is that, as Schumpeter wrote, distinction between debts according to purpose, however difficult to carry out, is always relevant to diagnosis and may be relevant to preventive policy.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Small, open developing economies in general, and small island developing states (SIDS) in particular, have specific macroeconomic characteristics due both to their openness and their small size. Small size means they can never have fully independent capital-intensive domestic economies, so to raise incomes they must become thoroughly integrated into the global economy. The export sector thus becomes the engine of growth; it provides domestic income, which is spent on domestic goods and imports, driving overall economic output through a multiplier effect. Building on work within the Caribbean structuralist tradition, this paper presents a demand-driven model that includes capital accumulation and external debt. Given the limited data available for many small island states, the model explicitly represents the external macroeconomic balance. An aggregate representation of the national economy is derived formally from a two-sector model, following models of a petroleum exporting country developed Seers and Bruce and Girvan. The model's performance was evaluated against the historical performance of the Caribbean countries of Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago.},

This article aims to highlight the role of carbon-intensive and debt-fuelled consumerism in instigating both the financial and environmental degradation of recent times, and discusses the appropriate role of consumption within an economic recovery more sensitive to broader economic challenges. It is argued that when a more holistic understanding of the recent economic and environmental outcomes is adopted, it is clear that recent consumption patterns - which have acted as a central driver of economic growth - has produced deleterious financial and environmental consequences and should now be considered unsustainable. Yet these consumption patterns have been entrenched by the policies undertaken to revive growth. Only alternative models of consumption and growth constitute credible responses to the current crisis.},

We argue that if the lending view is correct, one should expect the loan and security portfolios of large and small banks to respond differentially to a contraction in monetary policy. We first develop this point with a theoretical model; we then test to see if the model's predictions are borne out in the data. Overall, the empirical results are supportive of the lending view.},

abstract = {This article evaluates the contrasting approaches to the relationship among changes in the rate of profit, financialization, and crisis embodied in macrohistorical sociology and international political economy, and situates the financial crisis of 2008 in historical context, with US data from 1929-2008 as the core of the empirical analysis. While this article finds no correlation between either (1) the rate of profit and inflation or (2) cash assets of firms and economic decline, this article does find a correlation between a decline in the rate of profit and the advent of crisis. This article also presents evidence that dovetails with the proposition that crisis is associated with and follows financialization. The findings lend support to the Wallerstein-Arrighi hypothesis that within the context of capitalist hegemonic cycles, a decline in the rate of profit engenders an increase in the cash assets of firms, leading to financialization and, in association with other mechanisms, systemic crisis.},

abstract = {Four recent books on competition and crisis in the 20th century have contributed to renewed interest in Marxist theory while reopening some contentious issues. While central to all four books, the role of the capitalist state is not theorised systematically, a weakness which reflects an enduring gap in Marxist theory. One of the challenges when theorising the state is that the latter must be situated within a complex set of multiscalar relationships involving accumulation and competition. The author argues that the state must be understood as having multiple, intersecting determinations and suggests that a satisfactory theory of the state may be constructed by showing how these determinations arise from the logic of capitalist competition and crisis. Conceptualised as generative mechanisms, they denote not only the main influences on state decisions and behaviour but also-and crucially-the fundamental limits on state decision making.},

The model predicts that with mostly variable-rate mortgages, an exogenous interest rate shock has larger effects on borrowers than in a fixed-rate economy. For plausible parameterizations, aggregate differences are muted by wealth effects on labor supply and by the presence of savers. For given monetary policy, a high proportion of fixed-rate mortgages is welfare enhancing. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Ohio State University.},

abstract = {This paper develops a benchmark stock-flow consistent model that links functional with personal income distribution. The model consists of various household groups that receive income from different sources or from the same sources in different proportions. The dynamic linkage between functional and personal income distribution is formulated as part of a complete macroeconomic system. Inequality decomposition techniques are employed to associate income sources with personal income distribution. Simulation exercises are conducted to reveal the various ways through which functional and personal income distribution interact. In the simulations, a rise in the exogenous component of low-skilled workers' wage share reduces inequality in the short run; in the medium to long run inequality starts increasing due to certain macroeconomic developments, but remains lower than its initial level in almost all cases. A change in functional income distribution due to a rise in the dividend payout ratio of firms increases inequality both in the short run and the long run. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In the different strands of financialization literature, housing either plays a minor role or is simply seen as one of the bearers of financialization. The relations between housing and financialization are under-researched and under-theorized. This article, first, looks at the rise of housing finance as an integral part of macroeconomic policy, and second, at the role of financial globalization in the rise of housing finance. Housing is seen as an absorber of a 'wall of money', but the absorption of finance by housing is a very uneven process. Four trajectories of national institutional structures are suggested, and it is discussed how capital flows are absorbed in each of these trajectories. Finally, it is discussed what this tells about the geographies of financialized capitalism, and its relations to debt, housing, mortgage markets and the spatial fix. {\textcopyright}The Author(s) 2015.},

It does so in two steps. First, it phrases the representative views of Davidson, Godley, Minsky and Tobin as different 'closures' of the same (SFC) accounting framework, calling attention to their similarities and logical implications. Second, it discusses unresolved issues within this approach and how it differs from 'modern' theorising. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

@article{Aalbers2016,
abstract = {There are two dominant discourses on finance: in the first, finance is the great enabler; in the second, finance is the great divider, the driver of social exclusion. What starts out as finance as an enabler can easily turn into finance as a divider. If someone's mortgage loan application is accepted, they may see finance as the enabler of homeownership, but if the loan conditions are predatory in nature, finance becomes a means of extraction. This paper focuses on two ways in which housing finance creates harm: redlining and predatory lending. This paper does not discuss new empirical research on redlining or predatory lending, but provides a selective overview of studies documenting these two forms of Housing finance as harm. These two forms of housing finance share a number of characteristics related to exclusion, social groups, geography and local impact. Mortgage redlining is a form of place-based discrimination from housing finance. By delineating neighborhoods in which lenders do not grant mortgage loans they exclude households who want to buy a house and those who cannot sell their house. Predatory lending is a subset of subprime lending. Predatory loans are designed to exploit vulnerable borrowers. The rise of predatory lending had little to do with the mantra of emerging homeownership markets. In conclusion, mortgage lenders have the power to harm potential borrowers through direct exclusion (mortgage redlining) or indirect exclusion through overpriced loans (subprime and in particular predatory lending).},

abstract = {The rise in the economic and political power of finance over a number of decades is hardly in dispute these days. While there is now considerable agreement among economists that unregulated finance has the potential to contribute to financial instability and financial crises, there is much less agreement about the long-term impacts of modern finance on capital accumulation and distribution. This contribution, focused on the USA, explores some of these relations under the heading of the ‘Social Efficiency of Finance', a term used here to mean the impact of financial institutions and relations on income and wealth distribution and on the development of the economy. The author describes some key dimensions of the rise of ‘roaring banking' in the USA in recent decades, outlines specific ways in which this financialized system has affected accumulation, distribution and growth, and presents some results of a simple ‘bottom-line' analysis of the cost of this financial system in the US, reaching the conclusion that the ‘social efficiency' of modern finance in the US is very low. {\textcopyright} 2018 International Institute of Social Studies},

abstract = {This paper develops a stock-flow-fund ecological macroeconomic model
that combines the stock-flow consistent approach of Godley and Lavoie
with the flow-fund model of Georgescu-Roegen. The model has the
following key features. First, monetary and physical stocks and flows
are explicitly formalised taking into account the accounting principles
and the laws of thermodynamics. Second, Georgescu-Roegen's distinction
between stock-flow and fund-service resources is adopted. Third, output
is demand-determined but supply constraints might arise either due to
environmental damages or due to the exhaustion of natural resources.
Fourth, climate change influences directly the components of aggregate
demand. Fifth, finance affects macroeconomic activity and the
materialisation of investment plans that determine ecological
efficiency. The model is calibrated using global data. Simulations are
conducted to investigate the trajectories of key environmental,
macroeconomic and financial variables under (i) different assumptions
about the sensitivity of economic activity to the leverage ratio of
firms and (ii) different types of green finance policies. (C) 2016 The

It decreases EME output and consumer prices while increasing net exports. Negative effects on output and asset prices are weaker, but effects on external balance stronger, for Latin American EMEs. We attribute such heterogeneity to differential EME monetary policy response to US uncertainty shocks.

abstract = {The period of the United Kingdom's Labour government, 1997-2010, saw two strident policy vectors. One was in the promotion of the creative industries as a lever for urban regeneration and national renewal in the face of the decline of its manufacturing base and the globalisation of its economy. The second was in the increased emphasis on financialisation to underpin both corporate and public sectors. Both of these were, in fact, intensifications of former Conservative policies developed through the early 1990s. This paper reviews some changes in the UK government policy on design, principally through its Design Council, as a function of the political economy during this period. It draws attention to important shifts in the professional practice of design and governmental promotion and use thereof--especially of service design and "design thinking"--that suggest a new attitudinal approach as to its role. It then places these shifts next to changes in public sector management and thinking. In particular, we see how certain conceptions and practices of design become embedded in its signalling of value in potentia rather than in putting value into things.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Data from the 1980s are used to examine the impact of institutional developments in UK financial markets on the effectiveness of monetary policy.  Four major impacts are emphasized: 1.  Financial innovations undermined the case for monetary targeting by causing a sharp fall in velocity and reducing the informational content of money growth figures and by reducing the authorities' ability to control the monetary aggregates.  2.  The sharp rise in personal sector debt has begun to cause widespread hardship, which may become a major constraint on policy operation.  3.  The rise in floating-rate debt relative to floating-rate assets within the personal sector means that a rise in interest rates causes a significant drain of income from the personal sector, and this intersectoral impact strengthens the potency of monetary policy.  4.  The unequal distribution of the growing debt means that a change in interest rates has a larger effect on the distribution of income in the personal sector.},

abstract = {This paper offers a systematic comparison of a wide range of
leaning-against-the-wind interest-rate policy rules within a
macroeconomic, stock-flow consistent, agent-based model. The model
generates endogenous booms and busts along credit cycles. As feed back
loops on aggregate demand affect the goods and the labor markets, the
real and the financial sides of the economy are closely interconnected.
The baseline scenario is able to qualitatively reproduce a wide range of
stylized facts. We show that a monetary policy rule that targets the
movements in the net worth of firms significantly dampens the credit
cycles and reduces the employment costs of financial crises, because
this indicator incorporates early signals of financial imbalances.
Performances of this three-mandate Taylor rule are also more robust to
the specific parameter values and regulatory framework than the standard
dual-mandate Taylor rules. Nonetheless, none of the policy rules under
study completely eliminates the high employment costs of financial
crises. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We revisit the old but still vibrant Post-Keynesian debate over 'fully-adjusted positions', defined by the long-run equality of actual and standard utilisation rates. The central proposition of this paper is that in a world where different groups inside and outside firms have different objectives, the equality of actual and standard utilisation should not be treated as the only possible long-run equilibrium condition. The argument is illustrated in a model of target return pricing with conflict inflation, building on the work of Marc Lavoie. A 'common language' for the conflicting claims by shareholders, managers and workers is developed in terms of target profit rates, and it is shown that these contradictory claims can be partly reconciled through variations in the utilisation rate. The analysis unifies history and equilibrium in the sense that the nature of final equilibrium position and the adjustment to it depend on the objectives of the dominant social groups. We distinguish a 'Fordist regime' and a 'financialisation regime' and produce simulation results within a simple stock-flow consistent model that are broadly consistent with the stylised facts of these distinct historical phases of capitalism.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc. U.S. households' debt skyrocketed between 2000 and 2007, and has been falling since. This leveraging (and deleveraging) cycle cannot be accounted for by the relaxation, and subsequent tightening, of collateral requirements in mortgage markets observed during the same period. We base this conclusion on a quantitative dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated using macroeconomic aggregates and microeconomic data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. From the perspective of the model, the credit cycle is more likely due to factors that impacted house prices more directly, thus affecting the availability of credit through a change in collateral values. In either case, the macroeconomic consequences of leveraging and deleveraging are relatively minor, because the responses of borrowers and lenders roughly wash out in the aggregate. These results suggest that household debt overhang alone cannot account for the slow recovery from the Great Recession.},

Now, these mechanisms are exhausted.

abstract = {This paper sets out a framework for understanding the impacts of the financial crisis and its aftermath that is based on the idea of three interacting spheres: finance, production and reproduction. All of these spheres are gendered and globalised. The gendered impact of the current crisis is discussed in terms of the impact on unemployment, employment protection and security, public sector services, social security benefits, pensions, and the real value of wages and living standards. Drawing on the analysis of the UK Women's Budget Group, the paper demonstrates that the biggest falls in disposable income as the result of austerity policies by the Conservative-led government since 2010 have been borne by the most vulnerable women--lone mothers, single women pensioners and single women without children. Working-age couples without children have been least affected. The paper then goes on to discuss what an alternative economic strategy, based on feminist political economy, might look like. It utilises the notion of the 'reproductive bargain', first developed to understand the transition in Cuba in the 1990s. It sets out a possible feminist economic strategy that insists on the incorporation of reproductive and care work into the analysis of alternative economic policies and links employment, wages and social security payments to public provisioning of trans-generational reproductive services. It suggests feasible strategies to finance the proposed Plan F--a feminist economic strategy.},

From 1980 to 2012, the number of private-sector workers whose employers provide a traditional pension plan fell from 38 to 17 percent, while workers participating in defined contribution plans, most commonly the 401(k), rose in the same period from 8 to 41 percent.5 Traditional pensions and 401(k)s differ in who is responsible for their funding and management.},

We also investigate what drives Mexican firms to borrow in foreign currency. We find that holding dollar denominated debt in a devaluation adversely affects firms' earnings and investment. However, exporters invested more than non-exporters in the same period. We also find that the negative effect of dollar debt was stronger than the positive effect of exports in the 1994 crisis for firms with positive dollar debt and/or exports, relative to firms that did not borrow abroad and/or export. This was a result of imperfect currency matching by firms. However, in the 1998 crisis firms managed the denominations of their inflows and outflows much better and these two effects were roughly equal in magnitude. We also find some evidence of currency matching by exporters, especially after the introduction of the floating exchange rate.},

Demand is decomposed into the total number of electricity accounts and electricity usage per customer, each of which is modeled separately. A two-stage least squares approach is used to estimate the per customer electricity demand equations due to the endogeneity of the average price variable. The results indicate sustained growth in population, employment, and income can be expected to exert substantial upward pressure on regional electric power demand. Furthermore, demand is found to be price-inelastic in this metropolitan area, suggesting that rate increases can help raise the revenues necessary to fund expansion of the electrical grid. {\textcopyright} 2014, Econjournals.

At issue is the contrast between a negative net-worth effect and a potential expansionary competitiveness effect for the tradable sector. We find that there exists little evidence that devaluations cause a positive impact on investment and sales for firms with dollar denominated debt. The maturity structure of Chilean firms is mainly explained by the size of the companies. Large firms will have a debt structure biased to higher maturities. Analyzing dollar denominated debt composition the evidence shows that larger firms maintained a higher proportion of dollar denominated debt reflecting the development of the financial sector in Chile.},

To protect consumers from the negative impacts of financial hardship-which can include the stresses of enforcement action and disconnection from essential services-legal protections have been incorporated into the regulatory frameworks for the consumer credit, energy, water and telecommunications sectors. In this article, we outline the findings of our study, which used a survey of financial counsellors around Australia and focus group interviews with Victorian financial counsellors to examine how these legal protections are being implemented by service providers in these four sectors. Our findings highlight a tendency on the part of service providers to take a generic, one-size-fits-all approach to compliance with these legal protections that prevents them from effectively assisting consumers struggling with debt. We discuss the particular shortcomings of this approach in the context of consumers living on low incomes-especially Centrelink incomes-and outline the policy implications of our findings for assisting these vulnerable groups.},

abstract = {Nykredit Institutions has a continued focus on the Nordic region as our core market, and we are pleased to introduce our covered bond handbook for Denmark. With around EUR- equivalent 390bn (DKK 2,905bn) of covered bonds outstanding, the Danish market has become the largest in Europe after significant reduction in outstanding amounts of covered bonds in Germany and Spain. Despite Denmark not being a eurozone country, 3{\%} of outstanding covered bonds are EUR- denominated and 96{\%} DKK-denominated. The Danish covered bond market is a very transparent market with a 210-year impeccable track record. All major issuers have AAA rated covered bonds, which makes Danish covered bonds more attractive in a shrinking AAA universe. The handbook includes an overview of macro-economic fundamentals and housing market trends in Denmark, as well as a description of Denmark's covered bond market and relevant legislation.

We present a detailed account of the literature with a critical assessment of the existing series and an agenda for further research. Italy is the country with a longer tradition in historical national accounting. while Portugal is just beginning to produce historical estimates. For each country we select the best existing estimates, that are published here for the first time - including a complete new set of output estimates for Portugal. We find a common pattern of GDP growth for all three countries - an intriguing feature that will deserve more attention in the future.},

abstract = {In the era of financialization, increasing income inequality could be observed in most developed and many developing countries. Despite similar developments in inequality, the growth performance and drivers for growth differed markedly among countries, allowing clusters of different growth regimes to be identified. Among them are 2 extreme types: the debt-led private-demand boom and the export-led mercantilist economies. Whereas the former rely mainly on credit-financed household consumption in order to compensate for the potential lack of demand (associated with the depressing effect of financialisation), the latter rely on net exports as the main driver of aggregate demand. Using a stock-flow consistent model it will be demonstrated how increasing inequality, depending on a countries institutional structure and regulatory framework, affects growth differently, explaining the occurrence of both regime types.

The treatment of identification now is no more credible than in the early 1970s but escapes challenge because it is so much more opaque. Macroeconomic theorists dismiss mere facts by feigning an obtuse ignorance about such simple assertions as "tight monetary policy can cause a recession." Their models attribute fluctuations in aggregate variables to imaginary causal forces that are not influenced by the action that any person takes. A parallel with string theory from physics hints at a general failure mode of science that is triggered when respect for highly regarded leaders evolves into a deference to authority that displaces objective fact from its position as the ultimate determinant of scientific truth.},

@phdthesis{Arboleda2015,
abstract = {Through an engagement with an emerging strand of critical urban theory that reworks Henri Lefebvre's notion of 'planetary urbanisation', this dissertation explores the complex relation between contemporary forms of resource extraction and processes of capitalist urbanisation. It does so through the case of the Huasco Valley, an erstwhile agrarian region in northern Chile that was comprehensively redesigned and engineered into a mining, energy and agroindustrial hinterland strongly embedded in global networks of production and exchange. The thesis begins by offering a general exploration of the political economy of the 1993-2013 commodity boom, which set the foundations for new institutional, economic and corporate scenarios that led to an explosive rate of industrialisation and urbanisation across remote and rural geographies of Latin America. In the Huasco Valley, this context has translated into socioecological plunder, disruptions in public health, labour precariousness, intraurban displacement, and exponential growth of household debt. On this basis, I suggest that the production of urban space that underlies geographies of extraction is intrinsically uneven and in that sense, symptomatic of a world order dependent on the ongoing fabrication of invisibilised and fractured peripheries that are subservient to the consolidation of a seamless global space for the efficient circulation of commodities. The dissertation then goes on to argue that the existing literature on planetary urbanisation has been insufficiently attentive to questions of labour and production, and this has precluded an analysis of the properly political underpinnings of the complete urbanisation of society. By advancing a materialist conception of history, I focus on labour transformations in the Huasco Valley to illustrate how, besides dispossession and socioecological degradation, the projection of material infrastructures for resource extraction has created the conditions of possibility for radical and emancipatory change. Processes of urbanisation taking place in this valley have not only transformed the built environment and the sphere of reproduction -via institutionalised forms of credit, cultural practices and consumer cultures-, but production itself. Automation, lean production, logistical networks, outsourcing and cybernetic systems, among others, have radically transformed instruments and relations of production, thereby replacing isolation and parochialism with vibrant forms of community, political organisation and metabolic interaction with extra-human natures.},

@article{Cesaratto2006,
abstract = {The paper critically examines the dominant neoclassical views on the adoption of mandatory Fully Funded (FF) pension schemes as a partial or complete substitute for the unfunded Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) type. According to this view, such a transition will have the positive real effect of endowing future generations with higher capital and output per head, since it should cause a once and for all increase in aggregate saving and the capital stock. This would prepare the economy for future demographic developments. We examine three obstacles to such a claim. To begin with, the reform may fail to boost workers' marginal propensity to save, since workers may contract their voluntary saving to compensate for the larger mandatory saving to FF schemes. Second, if PAYG's payroll contributions are reduced and diverted to Pension Funds, the larger private saving supply will be balanced by lower government saving, if the government is committed to honouring the current pension payments. Third, Keynes's saving paradox, reinforced by the capital theory critique inspired by Sraffa, shows that the rise in the marginal propensity to save does not result in an increase in capital accumulation, but rather in a fall in income and employment.

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to seek to apply Polanyi's theory of the double movement as a response to the effects of economic liberalization and globalization to the pre-2007 American economy. In so doing, it seeks to ascertain the reasons why this assumed double movement did not materialize until after the post-2007 global economic crisis. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is structured as a theoretical and historical analysis, building upon Polanyi's nineteenth century observations and applying them to contemporary policy economic and social experience in the USA in the late twentieth century. The argument proposes a correlation between the missing and/or delayed movement and the role of access to debt and participation in equity markets. Findings - This paper argues that Polanyi's concept of a societal countermovement has been absent from the post-1970 period of economic liberalism and globalization until just recently due to an explicit attempt by the forces of capital to circumvent its role in lessening the harmful effects of American capitalism. In particular, the double movement that should have sought to lessen income inequality, unemployment and wage stagnation was instead replaced by access to cheap credit and the democratization of market investments that spurred consumer purchases and a false belief that what was good for the markets was good for working class Americans. Research limitations/implications - This paper highlights the need for ongoing research into the sociotropic nature of trade and of economic policy, and its evolution throughout the contemporary period of economic uncertainty and economic transition. Practical implications - The paper proposes several policy implications arising from the contemporary application of Polanyi's double movement, notably related to international trade and public and political support for ongoing trade liberalization. Social implications - This paper highlights important connections in the relationship between economic policy and the day-to-day lives of those who are governed by it. Building on "everyday political economy", it provides a foundation for arguments that a new balance must be found between economic globalization and transnational capital interests and domestic stability. Originality/value - This paper promotes a novel approach to understanding the political economy of pre-2007 America, in particular the reflexive nature of economic policy and societal perceptions.},

abstract = {This study explores the changing functions of home ownership in the livelihood of the urban middle class. Home ownership has long served as a strong motivational mechanism for integrating private subjects by creating material rewards expectations and desire for status achievement. Although social aspirations for popular ownership of owner-occupied house have sprung up during the transition to democracy, such demands have gradually disappeared with the selective incorporation as homeowners. Since the financial crisis of 1997, the function of home ownership has extended beyond the guarantees of economic security to an exclusive means of survival. The recent decline of social solidarity in the urban middle-class lifestyle is observed in the territory formation strategy that pursues capital gains, and conservative ownership politics. This study concludes that privatized housing practices by home owners represents the pattern of life politics of the urban middle class in Korea today.},

Our results reveal the existence of divergent trends in key macroeconomic variables within the Eurozone. Moreover, the current account (CA) responds in the short-term to real unit labour cost (ULC) and discretionary fiscal policy. However, we point out the possible existence of a structural component of the CA. When assessing the medium-term determinants of the CA imbalances, catching-up, old-age dependency ratio and country-level specialisation (non-price competitiveness) are relevant variables explaining those imbalances.},

abstract = {This dissertation develops an analysis of the relationship between capitalism and human agency. Drawing primarily on the political philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and F{\'{e}}lix Guattari, I argue for a conception of social agency in terms of an activity of assembling and being assembled within a field of heterogeneous resources. In conjunction, I provide an analysis of capitalist social production that focuses on the genesis and reproduction of the specific resources and interests that are both the conditions of possibility for social action as well as the product of this action. The specific result of this analysis is a unique conception of capitalist social agency that is opposed and superior to the well-known liberal or Neoclassical concept of social agency (rational individual as agency), but also to the traditional Marxist conception (class as agency). In short, this dissertation contributes a concept of social agency that enriches our current explanatory framework for capitalist "phenomena" (e.g. crises, inequality, etc.).},

The simulation results show that China and the USA both benefit from diversification, while the Euroland economy slows down.

We examine the use of the System of National Accounts and introduce the concept of using input-output analysis for the development of social indicators. The use of satellite accounts for input-output analysis of environmental impacts and the development of environmental footprints has been well documented. The novelty of this paper is the use of a methodology frequently used to develop environmental indicators to quantify social impacts and to further the development of social footprints. We provide a case study of the use of social satellite accounts for labour, using multi-regional input-output analysis to develop a global inequality footprint for labour embodied in trade, and argue the case for the development of a system of social economic accounts, similar to the System of Environmental-Economic Accounts adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission in 2012. This work contributes to the development of social valuation metrics as a means for measuring societal progress and developing sustainability indicators for use in management and decision-making. {\textcopyright} 2014 United Nations.},

However, even if debt is a recurring topic in discussions about the current economic situation, economic modeling does not take into account debt as one of the crucial determinants of economic dynamics. The authors' contribution, in this paper, is to investigate the issues of borrowing and debt load by means of computational experiments, performed in the environment of the agent-based Eurace simulator. The authors aim to shed some light on the relation between debt and main economic indicators. Their results clearly confirm that the amount of credit in the economy is a very important variable, which can affect economic performance in a twofold way: fostering growth or pushing the economy into recession or crisis. The outcomes of their computational experiments show a rich scenario of interactions between real and financial variables in the economy, and therefore represent a truly innovative tool for the study of economics. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {Abstract In many respects the history of National Accounts (NA) and of Historical National Accounts (HNA) is common to all the Nordic countries, The first rudimentary accounts can be found by the end of the nineteenth century while the first income tax statistics of the early twentieth century provided a further stimulus. It was the 1920s and the 1930s, however, that saw the real breakthrough. In Sweden it took the form of HNA, and in the other countries the form of NA, with Denmark and Norway in the lead. The commodity-flow method provided the common characteristic. Later developments somewhat differed in the individual countries. All participated in the Kuznets project ofHNA. Denmark and Norway had obtained new series by the mid 1960s and the early 1970s. Sweden and Finland came later, at the end of the 1980s, and consequently today have the most up-to-date series. These though reveal differences in methodology and a new project has been started, whose aim is to revive the spirit of Nordic community.},

@article{White2010,
abstract = {The macroeconomic theories and models favored by academics, as well as those used more commonly by policymakers, effectively rule out by assumption economic and financial crises of the sort we are living through. (In particular, the longer-run dangers posed by the rapid expansion of credit and resulting private-sector balance-sheet developments are almost wholly ignored.) As a result, the current crisis was neither anticipated nor prepared for, and the crisis was also less well managed than it might have been. At the level of macroeconomic theory and modeling, this experience suggests that basic Keynesian insights need to be complemented by some insights from the Austrian school as well as those of Minsky. (Demand factors are important, but so too are supply-side and financial considerations.) Such a synthesis provides a reasonable explanation of the crisis and points to some of the difficulties likely to be faced in emerging from it. As for the policy implications in current circumstances, it needs to be better recognized that policies with positive short-run effects can have negative effects over a longer time period. If, as a result, fiscal expansion and monetary expansion have now reached their limits in some countries, supply-side policies must be given greater emphasis. (These would include measures to encourage investment, both private and public, as well as other structural measures to raise the potential growth rate of the economy.) Such measures, along with more decisive efforts to reduce the "headwinds" of over-indebtedness, should with time provide the foundations for a sustainable economic recovery.},

abstract = {The paper moves from a discussion of the challenges posed by the crisis to standard macroeconomics and the solutions adopted within the DSGE community. Although several recent improvements have enhanced the realism of standard models, we argue that major drawbacks still undermine their reliability. In particular, DSGE models still fail to recognize the complex adaptive nature of economic systems, and the implications of money endogeneity. The paper argues that a coherent and exhaustive representation of the inter-linkages between the real and financial sides of the economy should be a pivotal feature of every macroeconomic model and proposes a macroeconomic framework based on the combination of the Agent Based and Stock Flow Consistent approaches. The papers aims at contributing to the nascent AB-SFC literature under two fundamental respects: first, we develop a fully decentralized AB-SFC model with several innovative features, and we thoroughly validate it in order to check whether the model is a good candidate for policy analysis applications. Results suggest that the properties of the model match many empirical regularities, ranking among the best performers in the related literature, and that these properties are robust across different parameterizations. Second, the paper has also a methodological purpose in that we try to provide a set or rules and tools to build, calibrate, validate, and display AB-SFC models. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {This book provides an analysis of the global monetary system and the necessary reforms that it should undergo to play an active role in the twenty-first century. As its title indicates, its basic diagnosis is that it is an ad hoc framework rather than a coherent system-a 'non-system'-which evolved after the breakdown of the original Bretton Woods arrangement in the early 1970s. The book places a special focus on the asymmetries that emerging and developing countries face within the current system, and therefore on the development dimensions of the global monetary system and of global monetary reform. The book proposes a comprehensive yet evolutionary reform of the system that includes: (i) provision of international liquidity through a system that mixes the multi-currency arrangement with a more active use of the IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), the only true global currency that has been created; (ii) stronger mechanisms of macroeconomic policy cooperation, including greater cooperation in exchange rate management, and freedom to manage capital flows as a complement to counter-cyclical macroeconomic policy and other instruments of financial regulation; (iii) additional automatic balance-of-payments financing facilities, and the complementary use of swap and regional arrangements; (iv) a multilateral sovereign debt workout mechanism; and (v) major reforms of the system's governance, based on a more representative apex organization, more equitable participation of emerging and developing countries in decision-making, and a network of global, regional, inter-regional, and sub-regional organizations. {\textcopyright} United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER) 2017.},

abstract = {There have been large changes in the conduct of aggregate demand policy in the United States over the past fifty years. This paper shows that these changes in policy have resulted largely from changes in policymakers' beliefs about the functioning of the economy and the effects of policy. We document the changes in beliefs using contemporaneous discussions of the economy and policy by monetary and fiscal policymakers and, for the period since the late 1960s, using the Federal Reserve's internal forecasts. We find that policymakers' understanding of the economy has not exhibited steady improvement. Instead, the evidence reveals an evolution from a fairly crude but basically sound worldview in the 1950s, to a more sophisticated but deeply flawed model in the 1960s, to uncertainty and fluctuating beliefs in the 1970s, and finally to the modern worldview of the 1980s and 1990s. We establish a link between policymakers' beliefs and aggregate demand policy by examining narrative evidence on the motivation for key policy choices. We also compare monetary policymakers' choices with the implications of a modern estimated policy rule and show that the main differences are consistent with the changes in beliefs that we observe.},

@phdthesis{Levina2012,
abstract = {The last thirty years in the US have been characterized by rising financial profits as a share of total profits and the growth of banking activities yielding non-interest income. These developments pose two questions. First, what are the social relations enabling and sustaining financial profits and what are their macroeconomic sources? Second, what do these trends imply for the nature of banking and what kind of theory of banking can capture them? This study addresses these questions and makes four contributions.    First, a Marxist theory of banking is developed to capture the transformation of banking drawing on two characteristics: first, emphasis on liquidity provision through exchange of promises to pay among credit participants and, second, explicit connection between bank revenues and macroeconomic aggregates (wages, profits, assets). It is shown that a Marxist theory of banking can be a more general theory of banking retaining strengths of other approaches and overcoming their limitations.    Second, it is shown that the corporate form of business organization and the attendant capital markets create opportunities to extract a range of profits with similar characteristics, i.e., capital gain-like revenues. The key features of their simplest form—founder's profit—are shown also to hold for securitization revenues and, partly, for profit from mergers and acquisitions. These revenues hinge on wealth transfers across the society and, therefore, differ from profits from production.    Third, by bringing together the Marxist theory of banking and the analysis of capital gain-like revenues, liquidity provision is shown to form the basis for banks' sharing in capital gain-like income. The core functions of banking can, therefore, co-exist with, and even form the basis, for a significant transformation of bank revenues. Examination of the multiplicity of forms of capital gain-like revenues shows that their extraction is the common driving force behind the apparently heterogeneous activities associated with the transformation of banking.    Fourth, empirical analysis of the US bank holding companies confirms that capital gain-like revenues were a significant part of bank revenues in 2001–2010. Given the rising household vulnerability toward wealth transfers, this trend suggests a reinstatement of predatory aspects of finance in contemporary capitalism.},

@article{Raberto2019,
abstract = {We investigate appropriate banking and regulatory policies aimed at pushing the banking sector to shift from speculative lending, the cause of asset bubbles and economic crises, to green investments lending, so as to foster the transition to a more energy efficient production technology. For this purpose, we consider an enriched version of the Eurace model, which includes heterogenous capital goods, allowing for different degrees of energy efficiency in the production technology. Credit money in Eurace is endogenous and limited by Basel capital adequacy regulation on the supply side, while on the demand side it is determined by firms' investments and households' house purchasing. We introduce a differentiation of capital requirements according to the destination of lending, demanding higher bank capital in the case of speculative lending, thus encouraging banks to finance firm investment. As up-to-date capital goods have better energy efficiency in the model design, a higher pace of investment implies also a positive environmental effect. Results suggest that the proposed regulation is able to foster investments and capital accumulation in the short term, improving the energy efficiency of firms. However, reducing mortgages with a restrictive regulation has a negative impact on total private credit, and thus on endogenous money supply, weakening consumption and aggregate demand. In the long term, the contraction of total credit becomes stronger, and the negative outcomes on aggregate demand also affect investment. Therefore, in the long run, the positive effects on capital and energy efficiency become negligible, while the main economic indicators deteriorate.},

On average, across estimation methods, a strengthening in the fiscal balance by 1 percentage point of GDP is associated with a current account improvement of about 0.3 percentage point of GDP. With our preferred estimation method (quarterly structural VAR using government consumption to identify fiscal policy shocks), the relationship is stronger, in the 0.3--0.5 range. The association is stronger in emerging markets and low-income countries; in economies that are more open to trade; and when the economy is somewhat overheated to begin with. The effect is, however, notably weaker during episodes of large fiscal policy and current account changes, suggesting that fiscal policy may have a more limited role in correcting large external imbalances.},

@phdthesis{Strouss2015,
abstract = {Beginning with the notion that the dominant economic ideology in society is in a position to direct and serve the public interest, it is reasonable to ask if the public interest is well served by that ideology. That is the objective of this dissertation. In contemporary America, the dominant economic ideology is neo-liberalism, an evolutionary form of capitalism with its foundation in market fundamentalism, and characterized by an acute focus on profit and material acquisition and minimal involvement of government in the economy. The prefix neo derives from the ostensible return of liberalism to those free market values after a detour in the mid-20th century when it appeared that state intervention in the economy would result in redistributionist social welfare policies.    This dissertation examines the research questions: Does neo-liberalism serve the public interest? If not, what alternatives to neo-liberalism exist that better serve the common good? Answering these questions requires the subject to be parsed into a number of additional questions, each of which is explored in an independent essay. The essays discuss the nature of the public interest and role of self-interest in forming neo-liberal values. In addition, the essays examine the institutional responses to neo-liberalism through business as manifested by the corporate social responsibility movement and through government as manifested by welfare capitalism and, in particular, social democracy.    The conclusion drawn is that neo-liberalism is not conducive to the public interest and that social democracy offers a structure for a more economically efficient and morally just society. Policy prescriptions and arguments favoring social democracy are offered.},

abstract = {Current account imbalances have increased steadily in rich countries over the past 20 years. While the U.S. current account deficit dominates the numbers and the news, other countries, especially within the euro area, are also running large deficits. These deficits are different from the Latin American deficits of the early 1980s, or the Mexican deficit of the early 1990s. They involve rich countries; they reflect mostly private saving and investment decisions, and fiscal deficits often play a marginal role; and the deficits are financed mostly through equity, FDI foreign direct investment, and own-currency bonds rather than through bank lending. Yet there appears to be a widely shared concern that these deficits are too large, and government intervention is required. My purpose is to examine the logic of this argument. I ask the following question: Assume that deficits reflect private saving and investment decisions. Assume also that people and firms have rational expectations. Should the government intervene, and, if so, how? To answer the question, I construct a simple benchmark. In the benchmark, the outcome is ``first best'' and there is no need nor justification for government intervention. I then introduce simple distortions in either goods, labor, or financial markets, and characterize the equilibrium in each case. I derive optimal policy and the implications for the current account. I show that optimal policy may or may not lead to smaller current account deficits. I see the model and the extensions very much as a first pass. Sharper conclusions require a better understanding of the exact nature and the extent of distortions, which we do not have yet. Such understanding is needed, however, to improve the quality of the current debate.},

abstract = {Our society faces a dilemma. While continued economic growth is
ecologically unsustainable, low or negative rates of economic growth are
accompanied by adverse social impacts. Hence there is a need for
macroeconomic tools that can help identify socially sustainable
post-growth pathways. The emerging field of ecological macroeconomics
aims to address this need and features a number of new macroeconomic
modelling approaches. This article provides (1) a review of modelling
developments in ecological macroeconomics, based on the literature and
interviews with researchers, and (2) an analysis of how the different
models incorporate policy themes from the post-growth literature.
Twenty-two ecological macroeconomic models were analysed and compared to
eight policy themes. It was found that environmental interactions and
the monetary system were treated most comprehensively. Themes of income
inequality, work patterns, indicators of well-being, and disaggregated
production were addressed with less detail, while alternative business
models and cross-scale interactions were hardly addressed. Overall, the
combination of input-output analysis with stock-flow consistent
modelling was identified as a promising avenue for developing
macroeconomic models for a post-growth economy. However, due to the wide
interpretation of what ``the economy{\{}''{\}} entails, future research will
benefit from employing a range of approaches.(C) 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {The aim of this article is to examine the impact of shadow banking on credit expansion and the business cycle. I focus on two main functions of the shadow banking system: securitization and collateral-intermediation. The former enables traditional banks to expand their credit activity, while the latter allows the shadow banks to create new money by themselves. Shadow banking shows that non-banking institutions can also conduct credit expansion and generate the business cycle. Thus, the Austrian business cycle theory should be extended to take into account the way in which shadow banking activity changed the conduct of credit expansion.},

abstract = {This paper argues that the polarization of income distribution and the decline in the wage share play an important role in the generation of imbalanced and unequal growth, and that a pro-labour wage policy will form an important part of a policy package that generates a stable growth regime. A wage-led growth strategy is thus advocated. In the era of neoliberalism, growth processes have become imbalanced, either relying on growing debt ratios or on persistent export surpluses. Two growth processes have emerged: finance-led growth, where growth was fueled by increasing household debt made possible by asset and property price bubbles and financial engineering and export-led growth, where the main engines of growth have been net exports. Both of these neoliberal growth processes have come with wage suppression. Finally, the last section highlights a wage-led growth strategy as a possible alternative. It combines pro-labour distributional policies with structural policies that are favourable to wage-led growth. It has the potential for an equitable and sustainable growth process.},

abstract = {The current crisis is one outcome of the financialisation of contemporary capitalism. It arose in the USA because of the enormous expansion of mortgage-lending, including to the poorest layers of the working class. It became general because of the trading of debt by financial institutions. These phenomena are integral to financialisation. During the last three decades, large enterprises have turned to open markets to obtain finance, forcing banks to seek alternative sources of profit. One avenue has been provision of financial services to individual workers. This trend has been facilitated by the retreat of public provision from housing, pensions, education, and so on. A further avenue has been to adopt investment-banking practices in open financial markets. The extraction of financial profits directly out of personal income constitutes financial expropriation. Combined with investment-banking, it has catalysed the current gigantic crisis. More broadly, financialisation has sustained the emergence of new layers of rentiers, defined primarily through their relation to the financial system rather than ownership of loanable capital. Finally, financialisation has posed important questions regarding finance-capital and imperialism.

abstract = {Multiple risks have been building up in the Chinese economy during the past decade, exposing it to a possible financial crisis of increasing likelihood. Based upon the inductive reasoning from the conventional key indicators discussed by economists, this paper also adds a deductive reasoning by examining the incentive structure for key players in the Chinese political economy to gauge the risk of a financial crisis in China. It highlights the political and structural factors that are responsible for soft budget constraint, moral hazard from major players, and the lack of institutional foundation for sovereign credibility. It argues that recent policies have not only failed to address these issues but instead have further damaged the credible commitment of the state to the market economy and ratcheted up the course of a great meltdown. This paper calls for a fundamental institutional change in China's political economy in order to prevent perversion in the state-market interaction from spawning both political and economic crises.},

@phdthesis{Leuchter2017,
abstract = {This dissertation examines the entwinement of property, finance, and the state in postrevolutionary France, taking the Paris Stock Exchange as its primary object. It focuses on political discourse, theoretical and legal debates about the moral rightness and economic utility of financial phenomena such as public debts and futures contracts, and the legal travails of the Paris stockbrokers, who maintained a controversial state-granted monopoly on financial intermediation at the Exchange. These debates helped establish the conceptual and legal boundaries of property, which, as the repeated disputes over the Exchange show, were up for grabs. The French Revolution of 1789 ostensibly ushered out an age of legal privilege and ushered in an age of property; the story of the Paris Stock Exchange helps illuminate just why that age of property took the specifically capitalist shape it did.   The first half of the nineteenth century was a formative period for the modern Paris Stock Exchange. Emerging out of the architecture of the Old Regime fiscal-military state, but making striking departures from that conceptual-institutional apparatus, creditors and debtors, stockbrokers and lawmakers, revolutionaries and reactionaries repeatedly sparred over the nature of public debts, financial speculation, and the post-revolutionary state, in an age where public debts were to be justified not to fund military adventure, but for public and private economic utility. The modern Exchange thus was legitimated according to different theoretical grounds than prior formations; my dissertation explores the contours and boundaries of these grounds, illuminating the path of French capitalism and the implantation of finance capital in a discursive context otherwise quite hostile to it.   The persistent controversies over the Exchange represented repeated attempts to sort out what kinds of moral attitudes were appropriate to post-revolutionary society. What kinds of economic manipulation of property were just and fair, and how might valid limits be set by the proper authorities? Given the ambiguity at the heart of its legal definition, the permissible boundaries of property were left open to vigorous, sometimes acrimonious debate. What were the reciprocal duties and obligations state and citizen owed each other? Since the main tradeable security at the Exchange was formally a public debt owed by the government, then the way the government chose to handle that debt – whether to issue new debt or to write down a part of the existing debt, for instance – signified its evaluation of the normatively justifiable relations between sovereign and citizens. Likewise, individual speculation at the Exchange signified not just a desire for possible future gain, but also an index of civic faith, with the decision to buy or sell public debt functioning as both economic and political judgments. Government treatment of the debt, and civic attitudes towards it, thus carried moral valence, insofar as the debt was, literally, a bond between state and citizen. And what, finally, did the volatility of prices at the Exchange portend for the security of the social order? The Exchange, after all, was the site of dramatic price fluctuations, of fortunes won and lost in an instant. But if property in its purest form was thus proven to be so unpredictable, then it would seem that society was constructed on shifting grounds. This dissertation demonstrates that the debates over the Exchange were rooted in this conceptual ambiguity, with the brokers and their advocates employing the normative authority of property for a defense of finance capital.    “The true temple of modern religion,” according to nineteenth-century social critic Edmond Texier, was the Paris Stock Exchange, with the mores of the financial world seeming to permeate the whole of society. As this dissertation argues, moral rightness, economic utility, and legal justification were fused at the Exchange in the particularities of public debts, speculation, and finance capital. The path of the Exchange thus bore witness to the recalibration of the moral order in post-revolutionary society. Newly codified in law, private property was meant to coordinate social interactions, with the norms derived from property neatly guiding individual behavior. But no sooner was the supremacy of property proclaimed than was it challenged from within. For it was precisely the abstract and endlessly mutable nature of property at the Exchange that made it such a crucial financial center and such a persistent locus of controversy. Through the lens of the Paris Stock Exchange, this dissertation therefore creates an intellectual history of financial capitalism in nineteenth-century France.},

abstract = {The failure of most developed western economies to return to the rates of economic growth enjoyed in earlier times has raised the spectre of secular stagnation first identified by Hansen in the 1930s. Central to secular stagnation is the complex link between capital investment and innovation, prompting fears that the recent collapse in investment is both a cause and an effect of the so-called end of innovation. The emergence of so-called zombie companies suggests a curtailment of creative destruction. The paper looks to the smart specialisation agenda and demand-led strategies for innovation as a means of removing innovation activity from reliance on large-scale top-down capital investment, instead shifting the focus to the role of the entrepreneur in the innovation and growth process. Key features of smart specialisation are used to underpin the construction of a conceptual model (the microsphere) that presents policymakers with a framework to reconnect with the entrepreneur to boost innovation and growth at the level of the region. The model frames the microsphere within which smart specialisation takes place, and how this can encourage innovation among small non-growth rural firms. Influenced by New Industrial Policy and the social geographies underpinning reflexive capitalism, the model builds on the entrepreneurial discovery process inherent in smart specialisation. The model provides policymakers with a guide to operationalise a smart specialisation strategy. Finally, the model is tested in a case study based on the priorities of an economic strategy of a rural region of Scotland. {\textcopyright} 2016, {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract = {Despite Iceland's economic recovery, nearly 48{\%} households continue to struggle to make ends meet. This study argues, first, that the main reason behind over-indebtedness in this country is a loan system without parallel in Europe, based on a triple cost of credit (fix/variable interest, indexation of credit to inflation and negative amortization). Second, the problem is examined in the context of European law as some alleged malpractices of indexation have been referred to the EFTA Court. Third, the focus shifts to the debt-relief programme presented by the Icelandic government in 2013/2014 after the relative failure of previous debt-relief measures. It is argued that this plan will fail in the long run as long as the indexation of credit to inflation is not abolished. The private pension system in Iceland relies indirectly on indexed mortgage credit issued by the public Housing Financing Fund. Since a ban on indexation and a holistic pension reformare not expected soon, all present debt write-offbenefits will surely be eaten up by higher inflation. As long as indexation of credit is legal, the future scenario resembles less a debt-relief jubilee and more the theater play "Waiting for Godot ".},

abstract = {At the center of the on-going debate about the U.S. Social Security system is the question of whether the way the system is financed can cope with the future challenges posed by the retiring Baby Boom generation. The "reformers" suggest changing the design of the system by moving to fully funded defined contribution retirement plans. Others argue that the so-called demographic problems are being used as an excuse to privatize the system. But both sides spend almost all of their energy and time figuring out the timing of insolvency of the system and the validity of the assumptions made in each forecast. In contrast, the present study closely examines the changing macroeconomic dynamics of the system since the 1960s. The analysis shows that undermining of the system is caused not by demographic changes or financing mechanisms but by low wages and medical inflation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {An empirical review of the three fiscal stimulus packages of the 2000s shows that they had little if any direct impact on consumption or government purchases. Households largely saved the transfers and tax rebates. The federal government only increased purchases by a small amount. State and local governments saved their stimulus grants and shifted spending away from purchases to transfers. Counterfactual simulations show that the stimulus-induced decrease in state and local government purchases was larger than the increase in federal purchases. Simulations also show that a larger stimulus package with the same design as the 2009 stimulus would not have increased government purchases or consumption by a larger amount. These results raise doubts about the efficacy of such packages adding weight to similar assessments reached more than thirty years ago. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Even though in 2012, publications such as Morningstar were advising investors to "Watch Out for Puerto Rico," and pundits were commenting about a very likely default, by 2013 and 2014, Wall Street was frenetically buying up Puerto Rican bonds. Wall Street incurred in a risky behavior that is comparable with what happened during the 1980s Latin America crisis, the 1997 Asian crisis, the 1998 Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) crisis, and the 2008 mortgage subprime crisis. By giving a brief overview of a series of economic crises around the world caused by speculation and risky lending, this article shows that the case of Puerto Rico, a nonincorporated territory of the United States of America, mirrors the same patterns of financialization of the economy and risky lending. It suggests that Wall Street bought these speculative-level bonds since this type of behavior has always been compensated by a bailout either through the US Treasury or an International Financial Institution (IFI), thus posing a moral hazard problem. The main argument of this article is that Wall Street and other bondholders will try to get their risky loans paid by the Government of Puerto Rico by forcing austerity measures, and when this inevitably fails, they will turn to the Treasury of United States to recover their money. It concludes with the question on how long the Island will have to suffer through the wave of higher taxes and cuts on social services before Washington bails them out.},

abstract = {The crisis of 2007 affected banks, financial institutions and retailers at a macro-economic level as well as individuals and families at a micro-economic level. Following the acceptance of a crisis the politics of blame began, with politicians, the media academics and the public assessing who (or what) generated the crisis and what could be done to alleviate it. Three broad narratives of blame have hitherto been purported; the first views the crisis as an international crisis, or whose roots stem from the United States, the second suggests that the policies of New Labour generated the crisis and the third traces the origins of the crisis back to Britain's withdrawal from the ERM in 1992. In this article I present a fourth account which sees the crisis as stemming from the 1980s and the policies of Thatcherism. Specifically I argue that the 'Right to Buy' scheme and the Big Bang deregulation of 1986 shifted the labour-capital relationship decisively in favour of capital paving the way for the crisis of 2007. Through doing so I question contemporary policies introduced to try and alleviate the crisis, asking if they will create a new growth model or simply entrench/recreate the model developed in the 1980s.},

These include certainty or certainty-equivalence, which followers of Keynes reject. Macrofoundations of microeconomics are often proposed instead. We argue that the issue is more complex and explain why it is unlikely that a logically watertight fit between the two levels of analysis will ever be achieved. The complex interactions within and between the two levels suggest that it is unhelpful to assign foundational status to either level. We examine Keynes' General Theory is examined as an example and compromises are found to fit the two together.

abstract = {Within the postwar financial regulatory system, state-level regulations - particularly interest rate limits - constrained the profitability of bank credit card plans. But differences in law among the states allowed motivated institutions to circumvent local laws using these mobile financial instruments. Eventually, banks themselves became mobile, placing irresistible pressure on states to eliminate local restrictions on consumer finance. The critical moment came when Citibank relocated its credit card business to Sioux Falls, South Dakota, in 1981. By examining this move in its longer context, this essay provides a new perspective on the rise of consumer finance in the late twentieth century, one that emphasizes strategic manipulation of local law by firms pursuing a national customer base.},

Yet while thinking about micro-foundations is a productive enterprise, complex models based on such foundations are not necessarily more accurate than simple, ad-hoc models. Three decades of attemps to base aggregate supply on rational behaviour have not displaced the Phillips curve; inter-temporal models of consumption do not offer reliable predictions about aggregate demand.

abstract = {The Great Recession that followed the financial crisis of 2007 is not
only the largest economic crisis after the Great Depression of the
1930s, it also signals a crisis of economics as a discipline. This is
not only the consequence of the inadequacy of mainstream macroeconomics,
and specifically the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)
workhorse model, to forecast such a huge event, or at least to detect
the worrying tendencies towards it. Even more relevant is the choice to
explicitly avoid the modeling of large crises (that for someone is a
motivation for not attacking pre-crisis DSGE models focused on the
analysis of small deviations from the steady-state), so denying the
intrinsic nature of capitalism, a system that necessarily proceeds
through cycles and (extended) crises. The replies of the DSGE approach
to critics have led to extensions regarding for instance the role of
financial frictions, heterogeneous agents, and bounded rationality
(though typically in the form of quasirational expectations). The
alternative paradigm of agent-based (AB) macroeconomics can take into
account all these elements at once within an evolutionary modeling
framework based on heterogeneity and interaction, so capable to
endogenously reproduce complex dynamics, from small fluctuations to
large crises, due to innovation and industrial dynamics, rising
inequality and financial instability, and so on. The integration between
AB macroeconomics and the (post-Keynesian) stock-flow consistent
approach represents a promising way for the future development of this
research field.},

abstract = {AbstractEuropean anti-austerity and pro-democracy movements form part of a global wave of protests following the global financial crisis. Despite continuity of actors and a double critique of global capitalism and democratic deficits from the previous Global Justice Movement, the centrality of the nation as target and focus of mobilization is a significant difference in this wave. The economic impact of the crisis and austerity policies is insufficient to explain variation in mobilization across countries hardest hit. In order to transform economic/material grievances into collective resistance, grievances need to be channelled against specific targets, and interpretive frameworks of meaning tied to a collective identity need to be mobilized. In Europe, anti-austerity protests were initiated by two sets of actors, Institutional Left and autonomous actors. Autonomous actors linked anti-austerity claims to interpretive system of meanings framed around the crisis of legitimacy of representative democracy; targeted primarily national political and economic oligarchies; and mobilized newcomers through an inclusive collective identity constructed around the ‘ordinary citizen' as political subject. Democratic regeneration emerges as a significant demand, but is uneven in its resonance. It finds its clearest and most emblematic expression in the ‘movements of the squares'. To the extent that the ‘twin' crises (financial/democratic) are framed synergistically, they can be seen as counter-hegemonic, as they seek to rupture the consensus of the ‘post-political'. The presence or absence of a strong pro-democracy narrative that connects actors across sectorial and organizational differences could help explain variation between cases. Transnational diffusion processes have been crucial but have not (yet) led to a transnational movement. Given the significant role of the Troika in the bail-outs, debt renegotiations and austerity policies of those countries hardest hit, the low visibility of ‘Europe' in the mobilizations is surprising.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first empirical evidence in the history of banking on the question of whether banks can create money out of nothing. The banking crisis has revived interest in this issue, but it had remained unsettled. Three hypotheses are recognised in the literature. According to the financial intermediation theory of banking, banks are merely intermediaries like other non-bank financial institutions, collecting deposits that are then lent out. According to the fractional reserve theory of banking, individual banks are mere financial intermediaries that cannot create money, but collectively they end up creating money through systemic interaction. A third theory maintains that each individual bank has the power to create money 'out of nothing' and does so when it extends credit (the credit creation theory of banking). The question which of the theories is correct has far-reaching implications for research and policy. Surprisingly, despite the longstanding controversy, until now no empirical study has tested the theories. This is the contribution of the present paper. An empirical test is conducted, whereby money is borrowed from a cooperating bank, while its internal records are being monitored, to establish whether in the process of making the loan available to the borrower, the bank transfers these funds from other accounts within or outside the bank, or whether they are newly created. This study establishes for the first time empirically that banks individually create money out of nothing. The money supply is created as 'fairy dust' produced by the banks individually, "out of thin air".},

After endogenously determining structural breaks we select optimal pass-through models, which allow for thresholds and asymmetric adjustment. By applying these models to monetary policy shocks as well as cost-of-funds changes, we show that in post-break periods monetary policy transmission has become faster, that heterogeneity across the euro zone has decreased in some banking markets, and that more competition improves the pass-through predominantly in deposit markets. As national characteristics are still important pass-through determinants, convergence remains incomplete and monetary policy will continue to operate in a heterogeneous euro zone.},

A comprehensive macroeconomic instability index has been constructed by incorporating inflation rate, unemployment rate, trade deficit and budget deficit. Stationarity of data is checked with the help of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Perron (PP) and Dickey-Fuller Generalized Least Squares (DF-GLS) unit root tests. Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model has been used for examining the co-integration among the variables of the model and Vector Error-Correction model has been used for short run dynamics of the model. The empirical results of the study confirm the existence of co-integration between macroeconomic instability and income inequality in Pakistan. The results of the study show that macroeconomic instability has a deep-rooted impact on income inequality in the case of Pakistan. Hence, for achieving the desired level of income distribution, Pakistan should make its macroeconomic environment stable.},

Without presenting any reliable alternative time series the attempt is made to show the implausibilities and inconsistencies in Hoffmann sendeavour. This is done in two ways: first alternative plausible levels of relevant national accounting measures are calculated and discussed in order to demonstrate the direction of a specific bias and to indicate the consequences of certain assumptions (e.g. weighting schemes) in Hoffmann's figures. Secondly, I try to establish how Hoffmann S time series were in fact calculated. A preliminary conclusion suggests the construction of a new independent benchmark estimate for output before 1913. Should this diverge significantly from the Hoffmann-level a new attempt to reconstruct the German national accounts will be necessary.},

abstract = {Do external imbalances increase the risk of financial crises? This paper studies the experience of 14 developed countries over 140 years (1870-2008). It exploits the long-run data set in a number of different ways. First, the paper applies new statistical tools to describe the temporal and spatial patterns of crises and identifies five episodes of global financial instability in the past 140 years. Second, it studies the macroeconomic dynamics before crises and shows that credit growth tends to be elevated and short-term interest rates depressed relative to the "natural rate" in the run-up to global financial crises. Third, the paper shows that recessions associated with crises lead to deeper slumps and stronger turnarounds in imbalances than during normal recessions. Finally, the paper asks to what extent external imbalances help predict financial crises. The overall result is that credit growth emerges as the single best predictor of financial instability. External imbalances have played an additional role, but more so in the pre-WWII era of low financialization than today.},

It highlights certain aspects of Post Keynesian monetarism and explores Keynesian concepts of emotions relative to economics and economic sociology. Gunnar Myrdal's work on time and money contributes to the discussion. Underdeveloped areas of discourse in both sociology and economics are identified and the resulting superficiality of references to money are examined. Sociology, for example, has historically neglected concepts of future time and money, while economics has paid little attention to emotions and organizations. Removing these orthodox barriers allows economics to be informed by concepts previously relegated to sociology, such as emotions of trust and confidence. This process may induce the disaffected from both disciplines to draw from each other, creating an alternative, and ultimately more satisfactory understanding of money.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to analyze the impact of the IMF-led financial and corporate sector restructuring programs on nonfinancial corporate fixed investment in Korea since the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 1990s. In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 1997-98, the IMF and Korean government imposed a series of austerity-oriented financial and corporate restructuring programs, which has had serious consequences on investment and portfolio management patterns in the Korean corporate business sector. Relying on the recent financialization framework, the paper aims to examine to what extent this post-crisis financial and structural adjustment program affects the ability of the nonfinancial corporate business firms to increase their productive capacity. More specifically, the paper tests the hypothesis that nonfinancial corporate business firms' increasing payments to financial markets and their excessive reliance on short-term portfolio management may have negative impacts on real fixed investment for both nonfinancial and manufacturing firms. Using both standard OLS and GMM econometric techniques based upon both macro (1976-2009) and firm-level micro data (1Q 2001-2Q 2011), the paper finds that there has been a statistically significant negative correlation between the measured financialization ratio and the nonfinancial corporate fixed investment. This observation raises a number of important policy questions and provides a new angle through which one can critically examine the IMF's conventional austerity-oriented financial restructuring programs.},

abstract = {In many developed countries, house prices have been rising rapidly, mortgage debt has been increasing and affordability has worsened. It is in this context that the standard annuity mortgage is increasingly being supplanted by mortgages with non-standard features, such as longer terms or interest-only payments. Many of these new features aim to reduce the borrower's monthly debt service in the initial period of the loan. While these new mortgage types help households to enter owner-occupation and to vary their expenditure patterns, the long-term cost to the borrower cannot normally be less than for a standard product. Moreover, such mortgages can also be more risky: the interest-only borrower does not accumulate equity as an annuity borrower does, and loans with longer terms expose the borrower to greater risk of interest-rate or other economic shocks. As a result both borrowers pay more and the housing finance system may be more fragile. This paper brings together evidence from 13 developed countries about house prices, debt and affordability, and particularly the availability and market share of mortgages with these new features. It analyses trends over the last ten years and discusses the risks of these mortgages compared to standard annuity products.},

abstract = {The Belarusian economy is in a state of balance since 2016: trade deficit and gross foreign debt were reduced, the local currency strengthened. The problem is in resumption of economic growth, while avoiding trade deficit. The role of structural policy is to control the rate of growth of specific industries. Those industries that provide trade surplus should grow faster. Government was stimulated both investment and consumer demand in the period from 2006 to 2014. As a result, GDP growth reached 5-12{\%}, but subsequently the gross foreign debt exceeded 75{\%} of GDP. We have found that economic growth stimulation through quantitative easing in a small open economy usually leads to imbalances. Furthermore, imbalances reach critical levels if exports declining. In 2016 the situation with exports was extremely unfavorable for Belarus. Therefore, if government could not abandon stimulation entirely, it should still apply it selectively, in order to avoid imbalances. For this purpose, we propose to differentiate the industries in their contribution to the trade balance. We offer a tool for assessing the contribution of each sector of economy (industry, or a product) to the trade balance. Baseline data are presented in the Input-Output tables, and the methodology is based on the Trade in Value Added (TiVA) indicators. Particularly, we line up the aggregate value chains for each final product, distinguishing foreign and domestic value added in gross exports and final demand for each industry. The estimates of the Belarusian economy made it possible to divide the industries into three groups, according to their contribution to the trade balance: Group 1: Products that contribute trade surplus. Domestic value added embodied in these products exceeds domestic final demand, taking into account the intermediate and final imports. This group includes: petroleum products, chemicals, transport services, business services (including software development). Group 2: Products creating trade deficit. Final demand for these products exceeds domestic value added - they are construction services, as well as manufacturing products: machinery and equipment, electronics and vehicles. Group 3: Relatively neutral to the trade balance products, which include garment, wood, retailing, and some others. For instance, it was found that the construction industry creates {\$}3,5-4,5 billion of net imports, while total gross imports equals {\$}44-48 billion in 2012 - 2014. In this period, petroleum products contributed approximately the same amount (if take into consideration export margins) to the domestic value added embodied in gross exports. In 2016 exports of petroleum products declined on a half. The volume of construction works was also halved, that allowed avoiding trade imbalance.},

We identify five varieties of industrialized countries, characterized by national levels of 'labor support' and 'strictness of employment protection,' and analyze the importance of the role of the state in mediating the impact of globalization on economic security by estimating the relation between offshoring and the labor share of income across the OECD. We find that the effect of offshoring varies across countries depending on their regulatory structure and in particular on the degree of labor market support provided by governments. Regression analysis shows that for the countries providing 'more support', offshoring has a less unfavorable or more favorable effect on the labor share of national income. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Abstract: Monetary circuit (MC) theory is one of the most interesting attempts to formally describe the functioning of a monetary production economy as centered on the concept of the flux–reflux of money. Endogenous money creation by commercial banks allows the circuit to open and firms to implement production processes. Financial markets “passively” close the circuit by intermediating savings via bond and equity issuance. Despite its natural focus on financial-real side links, the monetary circuit literature has paid relatively little attention to “financialization” and the way it has modified real-financial dynamics. In this article, we analyze whether the flux–reflux perspective of the circuit may be fruitfully applied to the description of the linkages between the real economy and finance in a financialized economy. We propose two interconnected circuits, one for the real economy and one for the financial one. In this context, finance can still ensure a consistent closure of the whole system, thus directly allowing the functioning of the real economy. Newly developed inside-finance interactions, however, may indirectly influence real world dynamics, by easing/restricting access to credit/financial markets, and give rise to boom-and-bust cycles. Our aim is twofold: modeling modern financial worlds within an MC framework and understanding how financialization could have changed real-financial interactions. {\textcopyright} 2015, Copyright {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {As creators of credit money, commercial banks prevent the nonfinancial private sector from being constrained by its prior savings in accordance with the theory of the monetary circuit. Commercial banking provides the means for a private economy to break away from its financial constraint. Commercial banks are a blend of private/public institutions at the foundation of an economy's payment system, with the accompanying critical externalities. As the economy has moved historically from the prefinancialization era toward a hyperfinancialized economy, there has been a shift away from its traditional role of financing production. The activity of commercial banking has evolved, especially as a result of securitization. Commercial banks are now found at the center of one large profit-making transactions machine that largely denies their original role in the productive sphere. It is their new activities, together with all the associated perverse incentives that this transformation has created, that brought about the financial crisis. The article analyzes this evolution by studying more carefully the Canadian experience prior to and following the financial crisis.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the completeness of the European Union framework according to a bibliographic review of Keynesian theory and financial domination approach in response to the Optimal Currency Area debate in Europe. The hypothesis is that the monetary union in Europe is irreversible. The current stage of bank regulation and financial prudential supervision is analysed through a comparison between the official purposes of the European Commission for the monetary union, as well as its actions in dealing with the recent crisis, and alternate ideas for resolving both current critical scenarios and the Union's failures. In order to illustrate this framework, the European Central Bank's financial integration indicators are presented as a background. The European Banking Union emerges as one of the main points of possible reforms after recent facts and negotiation issues, despite its preliminary stage. The main conclusion is that dynamic tools must be applied aiming to overcome the rigidity of the Maastricht Treaty without breaking it, pointing to a federalisation of the European Union as a reasonable fate, if one has in mind the pressure over members for abandoning the agreement.},

Quantitatively, this decomposition suggests large effects of information and communication technology on the income distribution within labor, but only moderate effects on the distribution of income between capital and labor.

abstract = {This paper traces the roots of the financial crisis and Great Recession to a flawed US macroeconomic paradigm that was adopted around 1980 with the triumph of neoliberal economics. One flaw concerns the growth model. A second flaw concerns the model of global economic engagement that created a triple economic hemorrhage of spending on imports, manufacturing job losses, and off-shoring of investment. The new growth model hollowed out the economy and relied on growing debt and asset price inflation. As the process deepened the economy needed ever larger bubbles to grow. Financial deregulation and excess kept the model going longer than expected, but it meant the economy experienced a financial crash and deeper collapse when the contradictions finally surfaced. The United States needs a new economic paradigm and a new growth model, but as yet this challenge has received little attention from policymakers or economists. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

@article{Asada2011,
abstract = {This paper presents the 'KMGT' (Keynes-Metzler-Goodwin-Tobin) portfolio model and studies its stability properties. The approach to macrodynamic modelling taken here extends the KMG model of Chiarella and Flaschel (2000), focusing in particular on the incorporation of financial markets and policy issues. The original KMG model considered three asset markets (equities, bonds, and money) but depicted them in a rudimentary way so that they had little influence on the real side of the model. The only financial market influencing the real side of the economy was the money market (via an LM curve theory of interest). Here Tobin's portfolio choice theory models the demand for each asset in such a way that the total amount of assets that households want to hold equals their net wealth, which is a stock constraint attached to portfolio choice. There is also a flow constraint, that the net amount of assets accumulated (liabilities issued) by one sector must equal its net savings (expenditures). The Tobinian macroeconomic portfolio approach characterizes the potential for financial market instability, focusing on the interconnectedness of all three markets. The paper goes on to study the potential for labour market and fiscal policies to stabilize unstable macroeconomies.},

abstract = {We investigate the macroeconomic consequences of narrow banking in the
context of stock-flow consistent models. We begin with an extension of
the Goodwin-Keen model incorporating time deposits, government bills,
cash, and central bank reserves to the base model with loans and demand
deposits, and use it to describe a fractional reserve banking system. We
then characterize narrow banking by a full reserve requirement on demand
deposits and describe the resulting separation between the payment
system and lending functions of the resulting banking sector. By way of
numerical examples, we explore the properties of fractional and full
reserve versions of the model and compare their asymptotic properties.
We find that narrow banking does not lead to any loss in economic growth
when both versions of the model converge to a finite equilibrium, while
allowing for more direct monitoring and prevention of financial
breakdowns in the case of explosive asymptotic behavior.},

abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to examine the current financial crisis, suggesting that most analyses have attributed the crisis to a lack of business ethics, the rise of greed and lax regulation. Prescriptions offered to address this crisis draw accordingly on the need for greater regulation of market behaviour, business practices and boardroom pay. Whilst these reforms are necessary, they fail to recognise that such business practices have their roots in an extreme political and economic ideology - neoliberal market fundamentalism. This paper seeks to suggests that a greater appreciation of the nexus between politics, philosophy and economics is critical in order to develop a different practice. As such, the author provides a socio-historical and political context for understanding the present crisis before offering a critique and reform of the business educational agenda. The author argues that such a context would engender greater understanding of business practices and systems for both students and practitioners and would go some way in enabling them to fashion a more critical reflexive and engaged practice. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on a critical-historical review of the literature on the crisis. In so doing, the paper opens up the analysis to philosophical and political approaches to understanding financial crises. Findings - The paper finds that explanations for the crisis can be found through a critical appreciation of philosophical and political texts. This finding also suggests that current business and management education and practices can benefit from an incorporation of these historical strands of thought. Research limitations/implications - In drawing on various strands in philosophy, politics, economics and sociology, the paper finds that a singular account for the crisis is flawed. The paper also finds that a richer and deeper appreciation of the crisis can be found through a critical-historical positioning of the crisis. This necessitates an understanding of politics and philosophy in business practices and education. Practical implications - In explaining the crisis, the paper suggests that many of the current financial "innovations" are problematic and a more critical approach is needed to engage with these "new" innovations. Originality/value - The paper seeks to open up new vistas for business education and practices. Through a critical-historical interrogation of the crisis, the paper opens up new spaces for understanding international economics and business practices. This reflexivity is often missing in international business studies and most management practices. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {The effect of wealth on consumption is an issue of long-standing interest to economists. Conventional wisdom suggests that fluctuations in household wealth have driven major swings in economic activity both in the United States and abroad. This paper considers the so-called consumption wealth effects. There is an extensive existing literature on wealth effects that has yielded some insights. For example, research has documented the relationship between aggregate household wealth and aggregate consumption over time, and a large number of household-level studies suggest that wealth effects are larger for households facing credit constraints. However, there are also many unresolved issues regarding the influence of household wealth on consumption.We review the most important of these issues and argue that there is a need for much more research in these areas as well as better data sources for conducting such analysis.},

Using time-series data from 1914 to 2010, we assess the effect of partisan politics on financial deregulation and, in turn, the effect of deregulation on income inequality. We find that financial deregulation has generally declined when Democrats attain more power in Washington and that deregulation has contributed to rising inequality. We also learn that the partisan effect on deregulation has diminished since the early 1980s, suggesting that one way partisan politics has contributed to the recent rise in inequality is related to convergence on matters of financial deregulation. We explore several potential explanations for this post-1980 partisan convergence, finding evidence supporting the idea that globalization, the increasing availability of credit, and shifts in campaign finance were contributing factors.},

abstract = {Several bills to establish a national infrastructure bank have been introduced in the 112th Congress. This report examines three such bills, the Building and Upgrading Infrastructure for Long-Term Development Act (S. 652), the American Infrastructure Investment Fund Act of 2011 (S. 936), and the National Infrastructure Development Bank Act of 2011 (H.R. 402). These proposals share three main goals: • increasing total investment in infrastructure by encouraging new investment from nonfederal sources; • improving project selection by insulating decisions from political influence; and • encouraging new investment with relatively little effect on the federal budget through a mostly self-sustaining entity. The federal government already uses a wide range of direct expenditures, grants, loans, loan guarantees, and tax preferences to expand infrastructure investment. A national infrastructure bank would be another way to provide federal credit assistance, such as direct loans and loan guarantees, to sponsors of infrastructure projects. To a certain extent, a new institution may be duplicative with existing federal programs in this area, and Congress may wish to consider the extent to which an infrastructure bank should supplant or complement existing federal infrastructure efforts. It is unclear how much new nonfederal investment would be encouraged by a national infrastructure bank, beyond the additional budgetary resources Congress might choose to devote to it. The bank may be able to improve resource allocation through a rigorous project selection process, but this could have consequences that Congress might find undesirable, such as an emphasis on projects that have the potential to generate revenue through user fees and a corresponding de-emphasis on projects that generate broad public benefits that cannot easily be captured through fees or taxes. As with other federal credit assistance programs, the loan capacity of an infrastructure bank would be large relative to the size of the appropriation. The bank is unlikely to be self-sustaining, however, if it is intended to provide financing at below-market interest rates. The extent to which the bank is placed under direct congressional and presidential oversight may also affect its ability to control project selection and achieve financial self-sufficiency. More generally, Congress may wish to consider the extent to which greater infrastructure investment is economically beneficial. Advocates of increased investment in infrastructure typically assert that high-quality, well maintained infrastructure increases private-sector productivity and improves public health and welfare. Congress may want to weigh the benefit of the increased spending on physical infrastructure against the benefit generated by alternative types of spending. {\textcopyright} 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract = {The financialisation of advanced economies has developed in part through the widespread engagement of workers with the financial sector, specifically through the increasing adoption of household debt. Taking on debt establishes “investor identities” for borrowers, which disciplines borrowers to demand employment and marginalises worker bargaining power. Although increased levels of household debt have been linked with a declining wage share of national income, there has been little examination of the effects of the specific channel of mortgage credit, the largest source of household debt, on the wage share. A series of regression models were implemented to test the relationship between the total mortgage stock and the wage share of GDP in four different countries, across three different Varieties of Residential Capitalism. While the panel data results demonstrate a negative relationship between mortgage credit and the wage share across the typologies, the relationship is concentrated in the liberal markets of the UK and the USA, and does not hold independently in Sweden and Denmark. There are four important differences that may explain the divergent results: (1) mortgages in liberal markets are provided at a higher cost than in non-liberal markets; (2) the use of mortgage bonds in non-liberal markets facilitates renegotiations in periods of borrower uncertainty; (3) the level of collective bargaining in Social Democratic states may strengthen worker wage negotiations; and (4) workers in liberal markets are reliant on mortgage finance to access the home as a financial asset in systems of asset-based welfare. The combination of which may explain how the increased disciplinary effects of mortgage finance have resulted in the reproduction of the conditions for capital accumulation in liberal capitalist states.},

Some recent papers have discussed the role of non-capacity generating semi-autonomous expenditures in growth theory. This literature ties together several aspects of heterodox thought: growth and distribution; the Sraffian supermultiplier; Duesenberry's relative income hypothesis; the endogenous money approach and Kalecki–Luxemburg external markets. The basic message is that non-wage sources of effective demand, based on mortgage and consumer credit, can play a key role in inducing capacity investment and driving long-run output growth. This article gives a broad overview of the role of financed-induced semi-autonomous expenditures in growth, cycles and crises, and thus criticizes some of the previous approaches that claim to mimic actual cycles while abstracting from these crucial determinants of economic activity. {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

It offers a detailed account of debt as a generalized means of control and a powerful mechanism for generating, maintaining, and multiplying inequalities. Yet "debt" is not so much "sovereign" as characteristic of a quasi-sovereignty that remains susceptible to conflicts and contradictions. Thus, the essay asks questions about the limits of debt and debt accumulation. It also debates the possibility of debt cancellation, notably in the context of intensifying instabilities surrounding both the concept and practice of ownership or property.},

abstract = {In this paper we study an economy with a high degree of financialization in which (non-financial) firms need loans from commercial banks to finance production, service debt, and make long-term investments. Along the business cycle, the economy follows a Minsky base cycle with firms traversing through the various stages of financial fragility, i.e. hedge, speculative and Ponzi finance (cf., Minsky in The financial instability hypothesis: a restatement. Hyman P Minsky archive paper, vol 180, pp 541–552, 1978; Stabilizing an unstable economy. Yale University Press, 2nd edn 2008, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1986; The financial instability hypothesis. Economics working paper archive wp74. The Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, 1992). In the speculative financial stage cash flows are insufficient to finance the repayment of principle but sufficient for paying interest, so banks are willing to roll-over credits in order to prevent loan defaults. In the Ponzi financial position even interest payments cannot be served, but banks my still be willing to keep firms alive through “extend and pretend” loans, also known as zombie-lending (Caballero et al. in Am Econ Rev 98(5):1943–1977, 2008). This lending behavior may cause credit bubbles with increasing leverage ratios. Empirical evidence suggests that recessions following such leveraging booms are more severe and can be associated to higher economic costs (Jord{\`{a}} et al. in J Money Credit Bank 45(s2):3–28, 2013; Schularick and Taylor in Am Econ Rev 102(2):1029–1061, 2012). We study macroprudential regulations aimed at: (i) the prevention and mitigation of credit bubbles, (ii) ensuring macro-financial stability, and (iii) limiting the ability of banks to create unsustainable debt bubbles. Our results show that limiting the credit growth by using a non-risk-weighted capital ratio has slightly positive effects, while using loan eligibility criteria such as cutting off funding to all financially unsound firms (speculative and Ponzi) has strong positive effects.},

Here, Ty discusses the restricted understanding of austerity as primarily a post-crisis economic phenomenon that unfolded in the aftermath of the 2002 crisis -- or, as it is presented in more expansive histories, as the response to "stagflation" in the 70s as a strategy foisted upon debt-burdened nations by the IMF during periods of structural adjustment; as the technical name for wartime frugality; or as the failed successor to the era of New Deal recovery.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V. In this paper, we build a dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model with housing and household debt, and compare the effectiveness of monetary policy, housing-related fiscal policy, and macroprudential regulations in reducing household indebtedness. Excessive household debt arises due to exuberance shocks on house price expectations, which drive a wedge between the actual and the underlying fundamental value of houses. The estimated model also features long-term fixed-rate borrowing and lending across two types of households, and differentiates between the flow and the stock of household debt. Our main findings can be summarized as follows: (i) Monetary tightening is able to reduce the stock of real mortgage debt, but leads to an increase in the household debt-to-income ratio. (ii) Among the policy tools we consider, tightening in mortgage interest deduction and regulatory loan-to-value (LTV) are the most effective and least costly in reducing household debt, followed by increasing property taxes and monetary tightening. (iii) Although mortgage interest deduction is a broader tool than regulatory LTV, and therefore potentially more costly in terms of output loss, it is effective in reducing overall mortgage debt, since its direct reach also extends to home equity loans. (iv) Lowering regulatory LTV and mortgage interest deductions from their current levels would be welfare improving, while we find weak support for systematic leaning against household imbalances through monetary policy.},

abstract = {This paper presents a macroeconomic model that combines the economic impact of climate change with the pivotal role of private debt. Using a Stock-Flow Consistent approach based on the Lotka–Volterra logic, we couple its nonlinear monetary dynamics of underemployment and income distribution with abatement costs. A calibration of our model at the scale of the world economy enables us to simulate various planetary scenarios. Our findings are threefold: 1) the +2 °C target is already out of reach, absent negative emissions; 2) the long-term (resp. short-term) results of climate change on economic fundamentals may lead to severe economic consequences without the implementation (resp. in case of too rapid an application) of proactive climate policies. Global warming (resp. too fast transition) forces the private sector to leverage in order to compensate for output and capital losses (resp. to lower carbon emissions), thus endangering financial stability; 3) Implementing an adequate carbon price trajectory, as well as increasing the wage share, fostering employment, and reducing private debt make it easier to avoid unintended degrowth and to reach a +2.5 °C target.

abstract = {In his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century Thomas Piketty combines two distinct theories to explain the stylized facts of growth and distribution in capitalist economies. The first is an analysis of the concentration of inherited wealth driven by the difference between the rate of return on capital and the rate of growth of national income. The second is essentially the neoclassical growth model with a constant (net) saving rate and an elasticity of substitution between capital and labour greater than one. I argue that for these two theories to be mutually consistent, in a long-run framework in which financial wealth converges in value with non-financial capital, the interdependence between the rates of growth and return at the aggregate level must be recognized. Since in Capital the rates of growth and return are assumed to be independently given, I show that Piketty has built a fundamentally over-determined, inconsistent analysis of growth and distribution. I also show that Piketty's approach diverges in fundamental ways from classical, neoclassical and post-Keynesian models of growth and distribution, and in particular from the way they deal with the rates of growth and return in balanced conditions.},

abstract = {This dissertation examines Istanbul as a geographical and historical totality and focuses on four different and integral parts of this totality: its Ottoman past, its dalliances with modern planning attempts, the city's death throes in the face of rabid industrialization efforts, and its first true real estate boom. These divergent parts are scrutinized through the relationship between the state and space. This work investigates the different modes a city takes under different configurations of a state composed of, but not limited to, cultural, ethnic, religious, class-based, formal, and spatial elements. By studying Istanbul alone, it is possible to gauge divergent trajectories of the production of space that the city takes.     The changes in Istanbul's state-spaces are studied in five stages: the first involves the urban theory that engendered my critical stance on Istanbul and the production of space and how revolutionary urbanism can be harnessed to a re-evaluation of a semi-peripheral metropolis. The second part is related to an attempt in unraveling the early modern historical characteristics of the city and its overdetermining role in the formation of state mechanisms. The third part unearths the rupture that modernity instigated in the urban fabric and conjoining state institutions and mentalities that shaped the city. The fourth part focuses on the industrialization and population boom of the second part of the 20th century and locates the consequence of social developments in the urban space: the squatter settlements, the gecekondus. The fifth part grasps the cycles of boom and bust in the real estate investments in Istanbul and is concerned in the concrete production of space of the five decades since 1965.     To locate the configurations of state-space in Istanbul, four elementary components that create the state-space relationship are employed in this analysis: territory, place, scale, and networks. Amidst the interplay of these elements, the emergent middle class in Istanbul and its social and historical moorings in the urban built environment are revealed to be rooted in the erstwhile squatters, in the gecekondu areas.},

abstract = {International capital flows have increased dramatically since the 1980s,
with much of the increase being due to trade in equity and bond markets.
Such developments are often attributed to the increased integration of
world financial markets. We present a model that allows us to examine
how greater integration in world financial markets affects the behavior
of international capital flows and financial returns. Our model predicts
that international capital flows are large (in absolute value) and very
volatile during the early stages of financial integration when
international asset trading is concentrated in bonds. As integration
progresses and households gain access to world equity markets, the size
and volatility of international bond flows decline. This is the natural
outcome of greater risk sharing facilitated by increased integration.
This pattern is consistent with declining volatility observed during
1975-2007 period in the G-7 countries. We also find that the equilibrium
flows in bonds and stocks predicted by the model are larger than their
empirical counterparts, and are largely driven by variations in equity
risk premia. The model also predicts that volatility of equity and bond
returns decline with integration, again consistent with the data for G-7
economies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Similar patterns can be observed in post-WWII US business cycles. The initial upswings tend to be led by household investment and debt-financed personal consumption expenditures, which then wane in relative importance, and lead downswings. As those expenditures are financed in significant part by money creation, they function as an external market-driving accumulation by enabling monetary profit realisation-in a way analogous to Rosa Luxemburg's treatment of the public and foreign sectors. Empirical studies on wage-led/profit-led demand regimes typically exclude household investment or include it in with business investment. This paper argues that it is vital to distinguish an independent role for 'semi-autonomous' household expenditures as a driver of effective demand and cyclical dynamics. The failure to do so in empirical studies sustains misleading conclusions such as the perceived relevance of Goodwin-type profit squeeze cycles. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2017.

abstract = {This dissertation constructs data on financial structure using flow of funds accounts and analyzes the effects of financial structure on investment for eight (mainly) emerging countries (South Africa, South Korea, India, China, Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, Tunisia). The focus is on four questions: Which financial structures occur in emerging countries? Are there differences between emerging and developed countries and within the emerging countries analyzed? Have there been any trends which could support a convergence towards more market-based financial systems? Does financial structure have an effect on investment?    A database on financial structure is built for emerging countries which is used to examine actual financial patterns. It is empirically examined how investment is financed by analyzing the patterns of sources and uses of funds in the non-financial corporate sector. Significant differences are found on the sources and uses side within the countries analyzed and compared to developed countries.    The database is further used to examine the impact of financial structure on investment. Extending Minsky's investment model and using time series data the relationship between flow of funds and investment is empirically examined as well as an investment function is developed and estimated. In the investment function traditional variables are combined with a financialization and a financial structure variable.    The following conclusions can be drawn: First, although, a straightforward classification is not possible, the financial systems of South Africa, Chile and Venezuela can be roughly classified as market-based and the ones of China, India and South Korea as bank-based. Second, there are important differences in the extent to which total sources are used for investment. Third, the convergence hypothesis can generally not be supported but there is a trend towards more market finance. Fourth, compared to developed countries internal finance is less and market (especially equity) finance more important in financing investment. These unexpected observations can be explained by policy changes during the 1990s. Fifth, financial structure has important effects on investment but the relationship differs across financial systems. Sixth, the trend towards more market-based financial systems in emerging countries is problematic as these systems might be less efficient in supporting investment.},

It will then discuss the issues related to a single global currency in the context of the IMF's promotion of global financial stability as one of the key global public goods. The conditions associated with the theory of the “optimum currency area” including asymmetric shocks and the mobility of capital and labor are analysed in the context of the processes of globalisation and international security. The paper indicates that the mobility of capital, active participation of MNCs and institutional foreign shareholding have created a global economy in which capital now meets labor rather than, as in earlier decades, labor migrating to locations offering employment, which in turn has significant implications for the conditions attached to a global single currency.},

abstract = {This paper develops a simple two-country stock-flow-consistent model based on that of Godley and Lavoie. In order to motivate the use of stabilisation policies, persistent inflationary pressure and endogenous economic cycles are introduced into the model. Three scenarios are then simulated: a step decrease in real exports from country B, increased wage pressure in country B and an income tax cut in country A. In all cases, monetary and fiscal policies in isolation enjoy little success, but a combined monetary and fiscal approach to stabilisation proves highly effective. Moreover, the model suggests that the pursuit of autonomous inflation targeting in each country introduces excessive exchange rate volatility relative to an alternative rule in which one central bank takes a leading role in interest rate setting. {\textcopyright} The Author 2014.

@article{Schwartz2008,
abstract = {Comparative and international political economy (CPE and IPE) are justifiably obsessed with finance as a source of power and as a key causal force for domestic and international economic outcomes. Yet both CPE and IPE ignore the single largest asset in people's everyday lives and one of the biggest financial assets in most economies: residential property and its associated mortgage debt. This special issue argues that residential housing and housing finance systems have important causal consequences for political behavior, social stability, the structure of welfare states, and macro-economic outcomes. The articles examine specific instances across a range of countries. This introduction has broader aims. First, it shows that housing finance systems are not politically neutral. We argue that the kind of housing people occupy and the property rights surrounding housing can constitute political subjectivities and objective preferences not only about the level of public spending, but also the level and nature of inflation and taxation. Second, like the varieties of capitalism literature, we show that housing finance systems also have important complementarities with the larger economy. But we diverge from the varieties literature, suggesting that 'varieties of residential capitalism' are not explained by domestic institutional complementarities alone. Rather, what we refer to as financially repressed and financially liberal systems are globally interdependent. While welfare and taxation systems show high degrees of path dependence, transnational trends in the deregulation of housing finance have altered incentives and preferences for financial institutions, home owners, and would-be home owners. Finally, the introduction offers some speculation about how pocketbooks will drive politics as the global housing busts tightens mortgage belts around the waists of average Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development home owners.

abstract = {The questions of European integration have been influenced by various
aspects of debt and deficit in recent years. Economist and policy makers
discuss mostly the so called twin deficits consisting of government
budged and imbalances in balance of payment. In this paper we take a
perspective of national accounts to investigate the question of
macroeconomic imbalances connected with the European sovereign debt
crisis. More specifically we utilize the methodology of sectoral
balances lying behind Flow of Funds statistics and Post Keynesian
macroeconomic analysis. We use a simplified, highly consolidated
accounting model of an economy consisting of three sectors i.e. domestic
private sector of households and firms, government sector and foreigner
sector. Since every debtor has to have a creditor by definition, the
interconnections among sectoral financial balances get interesting views
and implications for Eurozone's housekeeping, like deficits at periphery
and surpluses at core countries or limitations on private sector
balances by various fiscal constraints.},

that macroeconomic fundamentals contribute little to explaining stock

liquidity proxies, play a more important role. The macro factors are
still important in fitting bond return volatility, whereas the

Measured by the frequency of formal regime changes, the two parts of history before World War I were the two most stable. Several years pass between each regime change, and nominal stability was first established and then maintained. Long lasting formal regime stability was due to the absence of large external shocks to the economy. It was also due to a modest expected role for economic policy during the periods of domestic economic stress that the country experienced. Wars and large terms of trade shocks, in addition to growing ambitions regarding policy contributions to domestic economic stability, resulted in more frequent formal regime changes during the next two parts of Norwegian monetary history, covering the period from 1914 to 1986. This period of time was also characterized by nominal volatility. Finally, the "long return" to monetary stability in the most recent period after 1986 has simultaneously represented a return to fewer formal regime changes.},

abstract = {Ten years have passed since industrialized countries completed the implementation of their financial liberalization programs (Abiad et al., 2008). The global financial landscape is characterized by immense complexity, global expansion, ownership concentration and systemic fragility, as is indicated by several stylized facts. The debt of corporations, households and governments has indeed increased massively: in the Eurozone, the volume of financial instruments issued by corporations was multiplied by 30 between 2003 and 2015, jumping from 1 billion to 30 billion euros. In the meantime, the cost of banking bailout programs in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis induced a sharp rise in public debt levels. Financial innovation has also intensified, echoing the massive development of the shadow banking industry (Gennaioli et al., 2012). In 2014, shadow banking represented 75 trillion dollars and accounted for 25{\%} of global financial assets (Financial Stability Board, 2014). An unprecedented rise of banking mergers, acquisitions and concentration has also taken place. A set of financial institutions has now been formally identified as “systematically important” due to their global size, complexity and interconnectedness (Financial Stability Board, 2014). For instance, the near doubling in size of the EU and US banking systems between 1996 and 2012 was entirely attributable to the growth of the 20 largest banks (European Systemic Risk Board, 2014). All these changes, which have exposed the banking sector to greater tail risk, have taken place in a broader context in which banks have abandoned their former “credit culture” in favour of a culture of “shareholder value” (Lazonick, 2013). Such unfettered expansion of the financial sector has had a myriad of implications for organizations, economies and societies. The concept of financialization has been put forth within a wide array of social sciences (including economics, sociology, geography and accounting studies) in order to encompass these changes.},

A simple real-side model with decreasing returns to factors and non-clearing goods and labor markets is disaggregated into traded and non-traded sectors and three regions (US, EU and Asia). A three region model offers two degrees of freedom and six candidate variables for endogeneity in international accounts. Applying standard income and elasticities approaches as well as a less standard "Bretton Woods II" closure in simulations suggests external imbalances can be reduced in the current recession with a mix of fiscal expansion and some Asian real appreciation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society for Policy Modeling.},

abstract = {While the current account of the euro area as a whole has remained almost balanced in the past two decades, several member countries have sizeable deficits or surpluses. In this paper, we interpret these imbalances as indicators of net capital flows among the euro-area countries. We distinguish between balances against the euro zone and the rest of the world and examine these for the EU-15 countries. We find that for euro members the net flows follow differences in per-capita incomes, even before the introduction of the euro. Our results show further that with the introduction of the common currency the elasticity with respect to per-capita incomes of net capital flows within the euro area has increased for the members of the euro zone. This increase can neither be observed for the flows between the euro members and the rest of the world nor for the flows between the countries that stayed outside the monetary union and the euro zone. We interpret this as evidence for increasing financial integration in the euro area. There is also some evidence suggesting that the introduction of the euro has led to some financial diversion. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In other words, this is a kind of capital accumulation model dependent on increasing income and wealth inequality on one hand and keeping wages low on the other hand. Such a model can be sustainable only with borrowing. It is an undeniable fact that lending-borrowing relation is one of the most significant leverages of capital accumulation. It seems that lending-borrowing relation deepening and expanding not only from global to national level but also from national level to households has become the center of the social life. This study will focus both on the financial capital accumulation process that started to rise in the early 21st century in Turkey and on indebtedness of households.},

abstract = {In a monetary economy capital is a fund. This idea is captured by the circuit of capital. We define a circuit for fixed capital and argue that it is closed when the fund that initiates it is recovered in a present value sense. The circuit of newly invested fixed capital must be equivalent to the comparable direct circuit of money. This is the condition for monetary equilibrium in the sense of Keynes. From this equivalence it is possible to determine what the imputation for fixed capital must be, implying a definitive income distribution. The solution implies that capital assets that last longerthan the period of the circuit earn pure rent.

@phdthesis{Ali2012,
abstract = {Do U.S. firms enjoy asymmetrically higher returns on aggregate foreign direct investment? There is considerable controversy about this 'exorbitant privilege' (Gourinchas and Rey 2005) as highlighted in the 'global imbalances' literature. We investigate the comparative profitability of U.S. foreign direct investment abroad (USDIA) relative to U.S. based foreign direct investment (FDIUS) using a sector-based analysis. We find—using both the average and, arguably, a more reliable measure, the incremental rates of return (Shaikh 2005)—superior returns to USDIA relative to FDIUS across different measures of profitability. Our results are robust across two different iterations - the first including all Non-FIRE sectors and the other excluding sectors which are 'sheltered' from international competition. Excess returns to U.S. capital are particularly pronounced for new sectoral investment. Surprisingly, the risk-return trade-off does not appear to explain the higher returns to the U.S.-owned direct investment portfolio. Despite a relatively higher tax burden, U.S. multinationals exhibit higher levels of greater profit share in value added and 'capital productivity' across most sectors. A comparative analysis of other industrial characteristics is also consistent with excess returns to U.S. capital. Our panel data analysis also compares the profitability and industrial dynamics of U.S. out-bound and inward foreign direct investment against domestic based U.S. production for the aggregate non-financial data as well as for the 'narrow measure of value added' which excludes industries lacking proper output measures (Foley and Basu, 2011; Foley 2011). On aggregate, foreign direct investment in the U.S performs remarkably poorly relative to U.S. direct investment abroad but also poorly compared to domestic industries. However, for new investment in manufacturing, domestic industries are the worst performers recording the lowest profitability as well as greatest volatility compared to both inward and out-bound U.S. direct investment. For the period tested (1999-2005), like U.S. based investment, inward foreign direct investment isn't employment generating while U.S. direct investment abroad produces the fastest gains in value added, investment and employment. We close by commenting on the implication of our findings for the stability of U.S. external balance of payments.},

abstract = {We propose a mean-field approximation to a stock-flow consistent agent-based macroeconomic model with heterogeneous firms and households. Depending on their investment elasticity to past profits, firms can be either aggressive or conservative. Conversely, households are divided into investor and noninvestor groups, depending on whether or not they invest a portion of their wealth in the stock market. Both firms and households dynamically change their type according to transition probabilities specified exogenously. The mean-field approximation consists of homogenizing the balance-sheet variables for agents (firms or households) of the same type and computing the time evolution of the corresponding average as a combination of the deterministic dynamic, derived from investment and consumption decisions before a change of type, and the probabilistic change in type, with an appropriate rebalancing to take stock-flow consistency into account. The last step of the approximation consists in replacing the underlying Markov chain with a continuous-time diffusive limit. We present numerical experiments showing the accuracy of the approximation and the sensitivity of the model with respect to several discretionary parameters. {\textcopyright} 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.},

@article{Bholat2013,
abstract = {"Systemic risk" now occupies centre stage in discussions of bank regulatory reform. Systemic risk is often seen as a problem of size, operational complexity, interconnectivity and contagion. It is less often discussed in terms of the institutional framework of legal rules and principles within which financial intermediation takes place, and the organizational culture promoted by those structures. In this article we redress this deficit through an appraisal of Northern Rock, illustrating the consequences of its transformation from mutually owned building society to publicly held company on organisational culture. These changes had profound effects on the incentive structure of its owners and managers, as profit-maximisation and shareholder value became the driving force within the firm, as in much of the rest of the UK banking sector. Thus, in addition to grappling with risk and uncertainty-and taking care to distinguish between the two-current efforts to construct a new macro-prudential regulatory paradigm should recognise the importance of Frank Knight's third key conceptual category-profit. Furthermore, in seeking to understand systemic risk, it becomes necessary to delve into micro-legal concepts such as property, trust, and contract that govern different forms of business to discern whether or not some modes of financial association create a greater degree of systemic risk than others. This is especially so when one organizational model comes to dominate retail markets, as did the publicly held company in the UK banking sector at the turn of the twenty-first century.

abstract = {Macroeconomic dynamics are characterized by alternating patterns of periods of relative stability and large swings. Standard microfounded macroeconomic models account for these patterns through exogenous and persistent shocks. In this article, we develop a fully decentralized and microfounded macroeconomic agent-based model, augmented with an opinion model, which produces endogenous waves of pessimism and optimism that feed back into firms' leverage and households' precautionary saving behaviour. A major emergent property of our model is precisely the complex successions of stable and unstable macroeconomic regimes. The model is further able to account for a wide spectrum of macro and micro empirical regularities. Within this framework, we analyse a series of macroeconomic phenomena of key relevance in the current macroeconomic debate, especially the occurrence of deleveraging crises and Fisherian debt-deflation recessions. Our analysis suggests that the relative dynamics of prices and wages and the resulting income distribution along a deflationary path are critical determinants of the severity of the recession and the chances of recovery. {\textcopyright} 2015, {\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Starting in the U.S as a subprime mortgage crisis in the second half of 2007, the financial crisis gained a global character when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in September 2008. Peripheral countries in the Eurozone especially were affected by the crisis since the global crisis turned into a sovereign debt crisis in those countries, particularly in Greece and Ireland. However, the reason why the crisis was felt so deeply in Greece and Ireland is that both countries already had problems resulting from country-specific factors. The reason for analyzing Greece and Ireland in this study is that they are the two most severely affected countries in the European Union by the financial crisis of 2008. However, during the period from their Euro accession to the outbreak of the crisis, both of these countries had high growth rates. Despite the high growth rates achieved, why did these two economies experience big problems because of the global financial crisis? Both applied for EU/IMF funds in order to overcome the crisis but their processes of overcoming the crisis were different. What are the underlying reasons for this? Did adoption of the Euro make these countries more vulnerable to the global crisis or did being within the Eurozone facilitate their process of overcoming the crisis? These are the main questions to be answered in this study.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc. U.S. households' debt skyrocketed between 2000 and 2007, and has been falling since. This leveraging (and deleveraging) cycle cannot be accounted for by the relaxation, and subsequent tightening, of collateral requirements in mortgage markets observed during the same period. We base this conclusion on a quantitative dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated using macroeconomic aggregates and microeconomic data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. From the perspective of the model, the credit cycle is more likely due to factors that impacted house prices more directly, thus affecting the availability of credit through a change in collateral values. In either case, the macroeconomic consequences of leveraging and deleveraging are relatively minor, because the responses of borrowers and lenders roughly wash out in the aggregate. These results suggest that household debt overhang alone cannot account for the slow recovery from the Great Recession.},

It is argued that Bitcoin is commodity money without gold, fiat money without a state, and credit money without debt. In conclusion, it is suggested that Bitcoin poses an ideological challenge to conventional forms of money in so far as it not only provokes sedimented beliefs about money but also exposes the forms of exploitation, risk and even violence inherent in the existing system of state authorized credit money.},

Household and business net borrowing shares and thereby those sectors' contributions to effective demand are procyclical. Household borrowing over the cycle is led by residential investment. Consumption varies countercyclically, but it is offset by rising taxes as opposed to saving, suggesting that "consumption smoothing" by households as featured in much macro theory is not empirically important. Procyclicality of private net borrowing is countered by a countercyclical government deficit along traditional lines. In terms of trends, "twin" fiscal and foreign deficits appear infrequently, with the household and external deficits being much more closely related. The former is linked to a strong upward trend in health-care spending as a share of disposable income, with a corresponding downward trend in saving after the early 1980s.},

abstract = {The sectoral composition of global saving changed dramatically during the last three decades. Whereas in the early 1980s most of global investment was funded by household saving, nowadays nearly two-thirds of global investment is funded by corporate saving. This shift in the sectoral composition of saving was not accompanied by changes in the sectoral composition of investment, implying an improvement in the corporate net lending position. We characterize the behavior of corporate saving using both national income accounts and firm-level data and clarify its relationship with the global decline in labor share, the accumulation of corporate cash stocks, and the greater propensity for equity buybacks. We develop a general equilibrium model with product and capital market imperfections to explore quantitatively the determination of the flow of funds across sectors. Changes including declines in the real interest rate, the price of investment, and corporate income taxes generate increases in corporate profits and shifts in the supply of sectoral saving that are of similar magnitude to those observed in the data. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {What does the rise of shadow banking mean for monetary theory and practice? (How) should we change our traditional theories of money to capture the complex practices through which money is created in modern financial systems? To answer these questions, we approach money as provisional promises to pay, promises hierarchical in nature (Minsky 1998, Bell-Kelton 2001, Wray 2003, Mehrling 2012a, Mehrling et al 2013, Pozsar 2014, 2015). Noting that shadow banking is distinctive from relationship banking in that debt relationships are typically organized via marketable securities, we define shadow money as repo liabilities supported by tradable collateral. It is the presence of collateral characterising such private promises to pay that confer shadow money its distinctive character. In modern money hierarchies, market participants have developed an intricate mechanism for maintaining the exchange of money proper (state and bank money) with shadow money, a mechanism that essentially relies on the liquidity of the underlying collateral. We examine the dynamic properties of hierarchies with shadow money, and the systemic liquidity challenges that central banks face in stabilizing shadow money.},

abstract = {We construct an endogenous growth model of directed technical change with automation (the introduction of machines which replace low-skill labor and complement high-skill labor) and horizontal innovation (the introduction of new products, which increases demand for both types of labor). For general processes of technical change, we demonstrate that although low-skill wages can drop during periods of increasing automation intensity, the asymptotic growth rate is weakly positive --- though lower than that of the economy. We then endogenize the evolution of technology and show that the transitional path follows three distinct phases. First, wages are low, such that few machines are used and low-skill wages keep pace with the growth rate of the economy. Then, as wages grow, the share of automated products increases and the economy substitutes towards the use of machines -- depressing the growth rate of low-skill wages (potentially to negative). Finally, as the economy reaches steady state, the share of automated products is constant and the relative growth rate of low-skill wages recovers somewhat, yet remains lower than that of the economy overall. Allowing workers to endogenously transition from low-skill to high-skill alleviates the growth in income inequality, but does not alter the structure of the model. We extend the model to include middle-skill workers and demonstrate that the model endogenously captures the defining characteristics of the U.S. income distribution over the past 50 years: initially a monotone dispersion of the income distribution, and thereafter a wage growth polarization in which middle-skill workers experience the lowest wage growth. Finally, in an extension we allow machines to be produced with a different technology than the consumption good. This allows for faster productivity growth for machines potentially leading to permanently negative growth of low-skill wages.},

abstract = {The Eurozone crisis has revitalized the debate between economists on the role played by wages in open economies. Salaries paid to workers are at the same time a fundamental source of aggregate demand and a determinant of firms' international cost competitiveness. The paper investigates how alternative wage growth patterns impact on the economic dynamics of an artificial Monetary Union. For this sake, we perform several experiments employing the Agent Based-Stock Flow Consistent (AB-SFC) Multi-Country model first presented in Caiani et al. (2018a). Results show that a change in the wage growth pattern impacts in non-trivial ways on the demand and supply sides of the economies, giving rise to Keynesian and Schumpeterian effects. When occurring in a single country, wage expansions lead to a transitory deterioration of the country current account and to a slow-down of the economy in the short-run. However, on a longer time-span, higher wages tend to improve firms' innovative performance by strengthening the process of Schumpeterian competition, providing long-run benefits in terms of higher labor productivity which allow the economy to recover. Conversely, a coordinated expansion of wages in all countries, which leaves their relative competitive position unaffected, tends to benefit real GDP, labor productivity growth, and countries' public finance, while not affecting unemployment and countries' external balance. A specular dynamics characterizes the experiments investigating the effects of wage moderation. Extensive sensitivity experiments show that these results are robust to different dimensions of the Monetary Union and that the efficacy of coordinated wage expansionary strategies is enhanced when consumers give more importance to price differentials in their consumption allocation decisions. {\textcopyright} 2018},

Several copula functions that provide the necessary flexibility to capture the dynamic patterns of fat tail as well as linear and nonlinear interdependences are used to model the degree of cross-market linkages. Using daily return data from Brazil, Russia, India, China (BRIC) and the US, our empirical results show strong evidence of time-varying dependence between each of the BRIC markets and the US markets, but the dependency is stronger for commodity-price dependent markets than for finished-product export-oriented markets. We also observe high levels of dependence persistence for all market pairs during both bullish and bearish markets.},

To remedy this problem, multilateral development institutions have developed the concept of inclusive growth, defined as growth that allows all members of a society to participate in and contribute to the growth process on an equal basis, regardless of their individual circumstances. The most direct way to achieve inclusive growth in Asia is to bring the objective of full employment of the labor force (i.e., zero involuntary unemployment) to the top of the policy agenda. Specific policies to achieve it are: (i) Redress the neglect of agriculture; (ii) Undertake public investment in basic infrastructure; (iii) Use of industrial policy to accelerate industrialization and structural transformation in general; (iv) Direct fiscal and monetary policies to the achievement of full employment; and (v) Devise Job Guarantee Programs (JGP) to ensure full employment with price stability.

abstract = {Abstract: For the past decade the US economy has been driven not by industrial investment but by a real estate bubble. As the economy's largest asset category, real estate generates most of the economy's capital gains. The gains are the aim of real investors, as the real estate sector normally operates without declaring any profit. Investors agree to pay their net rental income to their mortgage banker, hoping to sell the property at a capital gain (mainly a land-price gain). The tax system encourages this debt pyramiding. Tax favoritism to real estate-and behind it, to bankers as mortgage lenders-has spurred a shiftof US investment away from industry toward speculation, mainly in real estate but also the stock and bond markets. A post-industrial economy is thus largely a financialized economy that carries its debt burden by borrowing against capital gains to pay the interest and taxes falling due. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {This paper examines the impact of public information flows on the
volatility of the bilateral Chinese Renminbi-US dollar (RMB-USD)
exchange rates in the spot, non-deliverable forward (NDF) and futures
markets. By using the comprehensive RavenPack Dow Jones News Analytics
database that captures Chinese and US macroeconomic news releases and
their sentiment scores at high frequencies, we investigate the
circumstances in which public news sentiment is related to the
volatility of the above exchange rates. To account for the possibility
of different volatility regimes in the RMB-USD volatility, a two-state
Regime-Switching EGARCH-in-mean (RS-EGARCH-M) model that incorporates
the effects of news sentiment is proposed. Our model suggests that news
sentiment has a greater impact on reducing volatility persistence in the
low volatility regime (calm state) for all the NDF and futures exchange
rates; in contrast, the impact is greater in the high-volatility regime
(turbulent state) for the spot rate. Furthermore, depending on the news
sources and sentiment, the marginal effects of news on these exchange
rates can vary significantly. In particular, compared with the USD news
releases, the RMB news releases have a stronger influence on the RMB-USD
volatility. Moreover, the impact of negative news sentiment is greater
than that of positive news sentiment. However, the effects of RMB-USD
volatility on contemporaneous returns are mostly insignificant. Our
RS-EGARCH-M model indicates that the estimated smoothing probability of
the RMB-USD spot rate can produce consistent identification of the
different economic states arising from changes in the macroeconomic and
exchange rate policies of the Chinese government. These findings have
important implications for China's exchange rate regime and the process
of RMB internationalization.},

The results confirm that the combinations of Post Keynesian policies have a large capacity to lead the economy toward the desired levels of output and inflation, while orthodox policies are generally incompatible with the Post Keynesian environment. A novel finding is that convergence for the output and inflation targets also means that maximum credibility is obtained and that appropriate policies avoid systematic forecasting errors, which cause a crisis of confidence.},

abstract = {Modern financial regulation has predominantly been economically-driven,1 progressing from addressing market failures to making markets more competitive and work better.2 The UK Financial Conduct Authority is expressly mandated to pursue regulatory objectives that maintain market integrity and protect consumers (addressing market failures) and to promote competition (making markets work better).3 Both the FCA and its sister regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority (for banks), have recently adopted innovative regulatory initiatives to promote technologically-driven innovation, aimed at making markets work better. These initiatives are also a response to the recent explosion of technologically-led financial innovation outside of the regulatory perimeter.In promoting financial innovation, we argue that the regulators have insufficiently focused on the need to govern financial innovation more generally. Although this concern may seem premature, the regulatory innovations are increasingly extending the perimeter for regulatory oversight of financial innovations. As the regulatory innovations have the potential to develop into more mature regulatory frameworks for governing financial innovation, we argue that regulators should manage the risks of their current approach and develop a regulatory strategy framework for balancing regulatory objectives and developing regulatory policy. We propose a framework anchored in rationality, consistency and accountability in governing financial innovation.},

This period covers the years of financial deregulation in the mid 1980s, the banking crisis around 1990 following the deregulation and the current international financial crisis. In the current version, long run consumption is homogeneous in income and wealth and there is also a significant effect from after-tax real interest rates. A change in the correlation pattern between real interest rates and wealth, which is related to a change in the monetary policy regime, is the reason why both variables need to be included in the long run relationship in order to explain the development over the period 2005q1-2008q4.

The model is a synthesis of the leading approaches in the literature. In particular, the framework exhibits a "financial accelerator", in that endogenous developments in credit markets work to amplify and propagate shocks to the macroeconomy. In addition, we add several features to the model that are designed to enhance the empirical relevance. First, we incorporate money and price stickiness, which allows us to study how credit market frictions may influence the transmission of monetary policy. In addition, we allow for lags in investment which enables the model to generate both hump-shaped output dynamics and a lead-lag relation between asset prices and investment, as is consistent with the data. Finally, we allow for heterogeneity among firms to capture the fact that borrowers have differential access to capital markets. Under reasonable parametrizations of the model, the financial accelerator has a significant influence on business cycle dynamics. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@phdthesis{Rudolph2006,
abstract = {This dissertation explains contrasting patterns of financial reform in China and India. It focuses on "securitization"---the structural shift from credit-based finance (banking) to securities-based finance (stocks and bonds)---as a politically consequential phenomenon in comparative and international political economy.    The analysis revises common theories of the developmental state---theories derived from Gerschenkron's emphasis on directed-credit and the state's role in capital formation---in light of securitization's growing global importance in the last twenty years. Contrasting responses to securitization are explained using international and domestic variables including the profile of a country's exposure to the world economy, the distributional coalition supporting the state, and the prevailing structure of property rights.    At a theoretical level, the dissertation highlights the political consequences of securitization for state authority in the economy, arguing that directed-credit, (1) enhanced state discretion in the management of distributional coalitions; (2) facilitated the perpetuity of poorly specified property rights; and (3) mitigated the consequences of the country's position with respect to external trade and investment.    Empirically, the research presented here demonstrates that China and India responded differently to the process of securitization, contrary to the expectations of globalization theories that identify finance as a domain in which international forces favoring convergence should be strongest. The thesis also shows that, in contrast to the scholarly depiction of China's authoritarian system as superior to India's democracy in the reform process, in the area of finance, Indian and Chinese reform patterns are mirror images: reform with substantive change in India, reform  without substantive change in China.    Finally, most scholars viewed China's massive foreign exchange reserves and world-topping volumes of foreign direct investment as signs of economic strength. This thesis suggests the opposite: these signs indicate Chinese vulnerability derived from an "affliction of abundance." India, however, made a virtue of its weakness, exploiting the "advantages of adversity." With little foreign direct investment, few exports, and (until recently) scant hard currency reserves, India chose to develop world-class securities markets and a rich tapestry of securities governance institutions in order to better mobilize and direct corporate finance and attract hard currency through foreign portfolio investment.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to appraise a few of the key innovative features of the early work in compiling SAMs for development policy analysis; to set out and review some recent methodological advances; and to identify those areas where compilation continues to be problematic. It briefly re-visits the features of the SAM as an integrating framework and sets out its relationship to the SNA 1993. The main compilation problems faced in practice arise from assembling the household accounts from household survey data where income data are especially unreliable and are difficult to link to the factor accounts and to income transfers. Experience is drawn from the construction of a Ghana SAM. In the literature relatively more attention has been devoted to balancing and data reconciliation methods, which are briefly reviewed, although these are second order adjustments and much still depends on the quality of the initial estimates.},

abstract = {This dissertation addresses the entanglements of Christianity and financializing capitalism in Colombia, South America. At its most empirical, this dissertation details ethnographically the debt upon which the Gospel of Prosperity rests. The ethnographic research, collected over two and a half years of sustained fieldwork, assesses Colombia's largest mega-church, a Protestant micro-credit program in Bogot{\'{a}}, various commercial banks, a rural Pentecostal community, and a multi-level marketing company. Together, this evidence establishes that financializing capitalism in Colombia depends upon a Christian morality. The evidence also makes possible the dissertation's more theoretical claim: that credit is a matter of belief. The argument begins with some reflection on the etymological fact that both words, credit and belief, share the same Latin root, credere, but then leans on participant observation, extended interviews, and life narratives to demonstrate how credit has become a matter of belief at the level of lived experience in Colombia.},

abstract = {The Great Recession substantially affected most developed countries. How countries responded to the Great Recession varied greatly, especially in terms of public spending. We examine the impact of the Great Recession on long-term services and supports (LTSS) in the United States and England. Financing for LTSS in these two countries differs in important ways; by examining the two countries' financing and program structures, we learn how these factors influenced each country's response to this common external stimulus. We find that between 2006 and 2013, LTSS increased in the United States in terms of spending (17{\%}) and number of people served; in contrast, over the same period, LTSS in England decreased in terms of spending (6{\%}) and people served. We find that the use of earmarked LTSS funding in the United States, compared to non-earmarked funding in England, contributed to different trajectories for LTSS in the two countries. Other contributing factors included differences in service entitlements, variations in ability of state and local governments to tax, and larger macroeconomic strategies implemented to combat the recession. We analyze the implications of our findings, especially as related to the potential shift to Medicaid block grant LTSS funding in the United States. {\textcopyright} 2019, {\textcopyright} 2019 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

@article{Ponta2018,
abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the effects on the economy of a feed-in tariff policy mechanism aimed to foster investments in renewable energy production capacity. To this purpose, we employ an enriched version of the agent-based Eurace macroeconomic model, where we have included an energy sector with a fossil-fuel power producer as well as a renewable-energy based one. Both power producers take pricing and capacity investment decisions based on the price of imported fossil fuel and the feed-in tariff government policy. Results show that the feed-in tariff policy is effective in fostering the sustainability transition of the energy sector and that it increases the level of investments with a positive impact on the unemployment rates. Moreover, we observe that its financing costs do not impact government finances, which actually improve following the better economic conditions. For high policy intensity, however, we observe an increasing GDP share of the investment sector in the economy, due to the building-up of renewable production capacity, with a resulting crowding out of consumption, higher interest rates and prices. The final outcome on household well-being therefore depends on what extent the chosen value judgment recognizes the importance of an economically and ecologically sustainable growth path.

abstract = {This article outlines the findings of Australia's first large-scale study on the experiences of people who have recently been unable to pay a debt when it fell due. The study builds upon empirical research on the causes and impacts of financial hardship in the United Kingdom and the United States, and examines the coping strategies that debtors employ to deal with their predicament. The study shows that although an overall increase in economic insecurity since the 1980s – together with rising living costs and rapid growth in household debt – have created a situation in which financial hardship can happen to almost anyone, people who are already in a position of socio-economic disadvantage are especially at risk. Debtors at all levels of income favour individualistic strategies for reducing their expenditure – for some, to the point of foregoing essential living needs. However, for debtors on social security incomes, financial hardship has particularly serious consequences, impacting negatively on health, relationships, and social inclusion, and undermining their ability to afford necessities such as food, heating, and medical care. This article undertakes an analysis of these findings in the context of the literature on economic insecurity, disadvantage, and the growing financialization of everyday life in Australia and overseas.},

abstract = {Keynesian models of household behavior suggest that a shift in the distribution of income toward profits - or toward rentiers - should imply an increase in the propensity to save out of income for the population as a whole. However, the available empirical evidence for the United States shows that, starting in 1985, the propensity to save out of income for the household sector has decreased steadily. Starting in 1981, the share of income accruing to the richest 5 percent of the population increased steadily, with wide fluctuations related to capital gains on equities and, more recently, in the housing market. The aim of this paper is to lay down a growth model, grounded in the Post Keynesian stock-flow-consistent approach of Godley and Lavoie, to analyze the links between consumption and saving behavior of two classes of households - financial markets and the housing market. The model will be used from a theoretical perspective to analyze the dynamics of markets along a steady growth path. {\textcopyright} 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.},

abstract = {Brazil's political-economic structure has rapidly evolved over the past decade, shedding its shallow policy alignment with neoliberalism of the 1990s. Brazil's large, diversified industrial base was painfully constructed over the course of the twentieth century. A major and sustained political realignment, which began in 2003, has resulted in two essential thrusts in development policy: (i) a "growth with equity" strategy that has dramatically reduced poverty and inequality; and (ii) a state-led "industrial policy" designed to upgrade manufacturing and direct the accumulation process toward specific sectors, highlighting and consolidating the National Innovation System (NIS). Nonetheless, as a result of the commodity boom that swept through Latin America, Brazil's natural resource sector achieved outsized growth from 2002 to 2012. One result has been a shift toward resource intensive activities and a broad opening to low-cost Chinese manufactures. Utilizing an institutionalist framework and method, this article analyzes the cohesion of the NIS and the emergence of the "deindustrialization" debate. Also, it assesses the instrumental nature of the "growth with equity" strategy. The article hypothesizes the viability of an endogenous "neo-developmentalist" strategy, while acknowledging the emergence of fundamental exogenous forces and structural ceremonial/institutional factors that have impeded the consolidation of a Brazilian social structure of accumulation.},

These efforts at deficit reduction/surplus generation did indeed contribute in many instances to lower federal budget deficits and even created surpluses. An apparent problem with deficit reduction/surplus generation is that every time government deficits are reduced, private-sector wealth also falls. Thus, growing levels of American household and business indebtedness are closely associated with the policy of reducing federal deficits.

abstract = {Abstract:   Although in the Schumpeterian process of entrepreneurial innovations money and financial markets are assumed to affect economic development, Schumpeter does not explicitly study financial evolution and its effects on real dynamics. In order to fill this gap, this article suggests a Minsky-inspired interpretation of Schumpeterian institutional dynamics in monetary terms. It then develops a specific Schumpeterian analysis of the evolution of financial institutions and regulatory mechanisms in the wake of the 2007-08 crisis and points to major consequences of financial innovations on economic stability. It appears that unlike the creative destruction process of entrepreneurial innovations, in a liberalised/deregulated environment financial innovations move banks from their crucial role of financing long-term economic evolution and lead to reckless finance. Thus, financial market dynamics put economies on a destructive path. Such an evolution calls for active and tight rational regulation in order to shape capitalist finance towards more stable and welfare-enhancing strategies. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Problems with this conventional view are discussed, as well as how these have been tackled, from pre-Solowian authors up to the recent New or Endogenous Growth Theory (EGT). These difficulties became particularly clear with the Solow-Swan model of growth in which the savings rate did not affect the rate of growth. In the absence of exogenous circumstances, savings would only depress the marginal productivity of capital forcing the economy towards a stationary state. EGT is interpreted as an attempt to react to this gloomy theoretical prospect. Various difficulties with this attempt are discussed.},

To this end, we use six-year panel data from Italian municipalities with populations above 15,000. Our results suggest that overestimations of current revenues are more frequent than underestimations, during both budget formulation and budget execution. In terms of determinants, our results highlight the impact on revenue misrepresentation of both political orientation and fiscal stress. Finally, in terms of purposes, we show that revenue underestimation during budget formulation and revenue overestimation during budget execution may contribute to the formation of surpluses. The former, in particular, may allow mayors to create a ‘war chest' in non-election years, which can then be used to increase net borrowing on the eve of elections. {\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Abstract This study investigates the impact of monetary policy shocks on the exchange rates of Brazil, Mexico and Chile. We find that even a focus on 1 day exchange rate changes following policy events – which reduces the potential for reverse causality considerably – fails to lend support for the view that associates unexpected interest rate hikes with immediate appreciations. This lack of empirical backing for the predictions of standard open economy models persists irrespective of whether we use the US Dollar or effective exchange rates, whether changes in the policy rate that were followed by exchange rate interventions are excluded, whether “contaminated” events are dropped from the analysis or whether we allow for non-linearities. We argue that it is difficult to attribute this stronger version of the exchange rate puzzle to fiscal dominance, as unexpected rate increases are not associated with increases in risk premia, and similar results are obtained in the case of Chile – a country that has had the highest possible short-term credit rating since 1995 and a debt/GDP ratio below 10{\%}.},

We consider a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with housing and collateral constraints. A macroprudential rule for the loan-to-value ratio (LTV), which responds to credit growth, interacts with a traditional Taylor rule for monetary policy. We compute the optimal parameters of these rules both when monetary and macroprudential policies act in a coordinated and in a non-coordinated way. We find that both policies acting together unambiguously improves the stability of the system. In both cases, this interaction is welfare improving for the society, especially in the case of the non-coordinated game. There is though a trade-off between borrowers and savers. However, borrowers can compensate the saver's welfare loss aỳ la Kaldor-Hicks to achieve a Pareto-superior outcome.},

abstract = {With continued economic growth and expanding mortgage markets, until recently the pattern across advanced economies was of growing homeownership sectors. The Great Financial Crisis (GFC) has however, undercut this growth resulting in the contraction of homeownership access in many countries and the revival of private renting. This paper argues that these tenure changes are not solely a consequence of the GFC, and therefore, reversible once long-term growth returns. Rather, they are the consequences of more fundamental changes especially in labour markets. The very financialisation that fuelled the growth of homeownership has also led to a hollowing out of well-paid, secure jobs—exactly those that fit best with the taking of housing loans. We examine longer-term declines in labour market security across Europe from before the GFC, identifying an underlying correlation between deteriorated labour market conditions and homeownership access for young adults. While variations exist across European countries, there is evidence of common trends. We argue that the GFC both accelerated pre-existing labour insecurity dynamics and brought an end to offsetting such dynamics through the expansion of credit access with the likelihood of a return to an era of widespread homeownership growth starkly decreased.},

abstract = {With the connivance of Parliament, was the Bank of England's over issue of banknotes inflationary? The inflation stemmed from military subsidy and Peninsula campaign payments, as well as food imports, far in excess of Britain's export earnings to cover these capital transfers (particularly when crimped by the Continental Blockade), and not merely from domestic credit over issue. Neither domestic money creation nor the fiscal theory of the price level best explains the imbalance in Britain's international accounts during the Napoleonic Wars. This deficit stemmed from domestic production shortfalls in essentials (above all food production) and contractual obligations such as military spending/subsidies relative to the pound's international purchasing power which emanated from the ability of Britain to sell exports and replace imports with domestic output (raise food production internally). These types of highly inelastic transactions tended to operate independently of domestic money creation, fiscal policy (taxes) or price developments (inflation). This article tracks England's bullion debate, which concerned whether gold prices rose (and hence sterling's exchange rate fell) because military capital transfers overwhelmed the balance of payments, or because the Bank of England over issued paper money after the gold cover was removed in 1797. The issues herein are not antiquated because the primary issues in monetary debates for two centuries have concerned the cause of inflation and deflation, and whether the domestic money supply or the balance of payments is responsible. Determining actual causation is critical for the proper solution: monetary deflation, or domestic and international restructuring of trade and investment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Local lending networks inflated enormous credit and property bubbles, which ultimately burst in 2011 with severe ramifications for Ordos's urban expansion and households' livelihoods. Based on fifteen months of ethnographic fieldwork in Ordos, the analysis advances the idea of "taking part" to explore the interconnected desires to participate in urban expansion and to seize for oneself a portion of the local bonanzas in natural resources, property, and finance. The socio-spatial impacts of the financialization of the everyday environment are discussed in relation to urban transformation, the production of a "ghost town," and local authorities' opportunistic forms of deregulation. These were vital ingredients in Ordos's spectacular passage from boom to bust.},

abstract = {Loss given default (LGD) models predict losses as a proportion of the outstanding loan, in the event a debtor goes into default. The literature on corporate sector LGD models suggests LGD is correlated to the economy and so changes in the economy could translate into different predictions of losses. In this work, the role of macroeconomic variables in loan-level retail LGD models is examined by testing the inclusion of macroeconomic variables in two different retail LGD models: a two-stage model for a residential mortgage loans data set and an ordinary least squares model for an unsecured personal loans data set. To improve loan-level predictions of LGD, indicators relating to the macroeconomy are considered with mixed results: the selected macroeconomic variable seemed able to improve the predictive performance of mortgage loan LGD estimates, but not for personal loan LGD. For mortgage loan LGD, interest rate was most beneficial but only predicted better during downturn periods, underestimating LGD during non-downturn periods. For personal loan LGD, only net lending growth is statistically significant but including this variable did not bring any improvement to R2. {\textcopyright} 2014 Operational Research Society Ltd.

abstract = {This dissertation consists of three independent essays. The first essay, “Long Waves and Short Cycles in a Model of Endogenous Financial Fragility,” presents a stock flow consistent macroeconomic model in which financial fragility in firm and household sectors evolves endogenously through the interaction between real and financial sectors. Changes in firms' and households' financial practices produce long waves. The Hopf bifurcation theorem is applied to clarify the conditions for the existence of limit cycles, and simulations illustrate stable limit cycles. The long waves are characterized by periodic economic crises following long expansions. Short cycles, generated by the interaction between effective demand and labor market dynamics, fluctuate around the long waves.   The second essay,“Macroeconomic Implications of Financialization,” examines macroeconomic effects of changes in firms' financial behavior (retention policy, equity financing, debt financing), and household saving and portfolio decisions using models that pay explicit attention to financial stock-flow relations. Unlike the first essay, the second essay focuses on the effects of financial change on steady growth path. The results are insensitive to the precise specification of household saving behavior but depend critically on the labor market assumptions (labor-constrained vs dual) and the specification of the investment function (Harrodian vs stagnationist).   The last essay, “Finance, Sectoral Structure and the Big Push,” studies the role of finance in the presence of investment complementarities using a big push model. Due to complementarities between different investment projects, simultaneous industrialization of many sectors (big push) may be needed for an underdeveloped economy to escape from an underdevelopment trap. Such simultaneous industrialization requires costly coordination by a third party, such as the government. Some recent papers show that private banks with significant market power may also solve the problem of coordination failure. We show that private coordination may not work since even large private banks may find it more profitable to finance firms in the traditional sector than in the modern sector.},

abstract = {This paper tries to trace the relationship between finance and growth. There are several indicators which represent the degree of financial intermediation such as M3, Real Rate of Interest (RR) and economic growth. In this paper, we have used Time-series methodology such as Unit Root (ADF and Phillips-Perron Tests), Cointegration (developed by Johansen and Juselius), and Granger Pairwise causality. We have checked the presence of unit roots in the data, and all the three variables-Financial Development, RR and Growth Rate-are found to be integrated at first difference. Secondly, Johansen cointegration test results confirm the presence of long-run equilibrium relationship among the variables. Finally, the Granger causality supports the hypothesis of 'Finance-led Growth' indicating that the finance is a leading sector in India and is poised for development. This result supports the supply-leading hypothesis for Indian economy for the sample period. These findings have important implications for the conduct of economic policies in India.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the interaction between macroeconomic environment and firms' balance sheet effects in Brazil during the 1990's. We start by assessing the influence of macroeconomic conditions on firms' debt composition in Brazil. We found that larger firms tend to change debt currency composition more in response to a change in the exchange rate risk. We then proceed to investigate if and how exchange rate balance sheet effects affected the firms' investment decisions. We test directly the exchange rate balance sheet effect on investment, but the results were not statistically significant. We then pursue an alternative investigation strategy, inspired by the credit channel literature. According to this perspective, Tobin's q can provide an adequate control for the competitiveness effect on investment. Our results provide supporting evidence for imperfect capital markets, but not for a balance sheet effect in Brazil. The main effect we found is that firms in industries with higher proportion of imported inputs tend to invest less when the exchange rate is depreciated.},

It first briefly summarizes the orthodox view according to which global savings financed the U.S. speculative boom. Excessive growth of U.S. indebtedness was unsustainable, and matters were made worse by Fed monetary ease. The alternative view is based on Keynes's approach to finance and liquidity preference, integrated with the "modern money" view of currency sovereignty. It is argued that investment, budget deficits, and current account deficits create saving; on this view it is more revealing to think of U.S. current accounts as financing global dollar savings.

abstract = {This study investigates welfare system retrenchment in the advanced capitalist countries over the period 1980–97. During this time, welfare retrenchment occurred along three dimensions: expenditure growth slowdown, organizational/programmatic restructuring, and policy reversal. Explaining the political attack on social provision has been a matter of controversy within the social sciences, yet an increasing number of studies are focusing on the impact of economic globalization on welfare system delivery. Research on the globalization-retrenchment relationship is marked by mixed conclusions. Some analysts argue that capital mobility and economic integration have produced a generalized convergence toward retrenchment, while others emphasize that globalization has either increased social provision effort or that it has had no impact at all on welfare system operation.    This study addresses both the theoretical and empirical limitations of previous globalization-retrenchment research. First, it conceptualizes and historicizes the processes of capitalist transformation over time, highlighting the crisis of capital accumulation and its subsequent reordering through economic globalization. Second, it provides an analytic framework that centers on the broader socio-economic context within which welfare systems are embedded. A comparative political economy approach to welfare system retrenchment allows changes in contemporary capitalism to be linked to social provision outcomes.    Historical analysis shows that the early 1980s employers' offensive was launched to restore capitalist profitability. Neo-liberal transformative action aimed to reorder post-war capitalism's structural and institutional arrangements, and to shift the balance of class forces in capital's favor. This neo-liberal reordering unleashed the economic transforming tendencies of state rationalization, market contestability, and factor mobility (“coercive competition”) on all nations. The importance of coercive competition is that it simultaneously acted on and transcended domestic institutional-policy frameworks.    In this new political economic context, domestic welfare systems faced a number of transformatory pressures, including the erosion of government autonomy over social provision, integration induced convergent welfare effects, and welfare system rivalry. The prime source of retrenchment pressures was that mobile capital has an aversion to anything that contributes to competitive locational disadvantage. How these pressures were dealt with politically determines the nature and scope of welfare system retrenchment.},

@article{Bernardo2016,
abstract = {The paper proposes a post Keynesian framework to explain Tobin's q behavior in the long run. The theoretical basis is informed by the Cambridge corporate model originally proposed by Kaldor (1966), which is reinterpreted here as a theory for q. The core of the "Kaldorian q theory is a negative long-run relation between q and growth rates, a negative relation between q and propensities to consume, and the fact that q can be different from 1 in the long-run equilibrium. We generalize this model through a medium-scale stock-flow consistent (SFC) model, which introduces important post Keynesian aspects missing in the Kaldorian model, such as endogenous money, a financial system, and inflation. We extend the model to include a more realistic treatment of firms' financial structure decisions and allow the interdependence between these decisions and dividend policy. Numerical simulations confirm that the original Kaldorian relations between q and growth rates and propensities to consume hold, but unlike the original model, in our model, q is not independent of how firms finance their investment. We also confirm the possibility of q being different from 1 in the long run. Finally, we contrast this "post Keynesian q theory" with the Miller-Modigliani dividend irrelevance proposition and the neoclassical investment and financial theory. It is shown that its validity depends crucially on the value taken by q: for q values different from 1 the proposition will not hold and dividend policy will be relevant for equity valuation. Therefore, post Keynesian q theory stands against the main predictions of mainstream finance and constitutes an alternative for developing a macroeconomic theory for equity markets.

At the most, some regulatory changes on capital and reserves of the banks could be required. However, to understand what really happens during financial crises and the changes in overall economic activity that they produce, a post-Keynesian institutionalist theoretical approach is essential. This paper discusses how several of the changes in funding relationships, driven by financial crises since 1980s, have cleared the way for money manager capitalism. The political and institutional diversity in Latin America allows one to observe not only the trajectory of change, but also its forms. These countries have made different choices regarding economic stabilization and financial regulation, with moderately different results in the distribution of income, wages, and employment. In turn, widespread difficulties to slow or abolish policies of austerity show the depth of the institutional changes that restrict monetary and fiscal policies in the context of financialization. I conclude that financial crises have changed the foundations of social organization.},

The contribution from Steindl has largely been ignored in the debate, despite its obvious potential. With the use of the theoretical foundation offered by Steindl, the stagnation of the Danish economy can be explained by a combination of the behavior of the house-hold, the investment behavior of firms and the public preoccupation with the fiscal budget.

abstract = {The surge of inequality in the past three decades in the United States is associated with the financialization of the US economy. By financialization I refer to two interdependent processes. One is the increasing influence of the financial sector over the US economy. The second process is the increasing participation of the non-finance firms in the financial markets. Evidence presented in this dissertation shows that financialization has profound impacts on income dynamics and employment growth in the United States. As the centrality of the finance sector increases, financial firms and their favored workers capture more resources from the economy. When non-financial firms channel their resources and attention from the productive units to their financial arms, they exclude labor from the revenue generating process and therefore diminish the bargaining power of workers. Furthermore, as resources are engineered toward speculative activities and the shareholders, employment growth and security decline, particularly for middle-class workers. I discuss the policy implications at the end.},

To question the relevance of the debt-money/positive interest rate/output growth nexus, this paper adopts a critical stance towards the currently emerging ecological monetary economics from the standpoint of another strand of heterodox economics - the post-Keynesian approach. In its current state, ecological monetary economics is at odds with post-Keynesian economics in its analysis of the money-growth relationship. This will be shown using the theory of endogenous money and a simple Cambridgian-Kaleckian model where debt-money and a positive interest rate are compatible with a full stationary economy. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Speculative capital inflows raised the exchange rate and stock prices in Iceland in the prelude to the financial turmoil that gripped the country in 2008. Speculators profited from the interest differential as well as the continued appreciation of the currency from 2004 to 2008 and the rise of stock prices. The inflow was not sustainable because domestic debt was increasing at an unsustainable pace, faster than the rate of interest. Investors attempted to leave the krona when international capital markets became unstable in 2008 and the foreign risk premium rose. The sudden stop of the inflows left most domestic businesses in technical default as well as many households, the banks collapsed and the currency lost half its value. Capital controls were imposed to stem the outflow. Now seven years later, capital controls are being relaxed and the inflow of speculative capital has started again. The paper describes the macroprudential regulations that have been passed in recent years and the possible ways the authorities could reduce the inflows or change their nature from short-term to long-term investment. The issue whether a very small economy can have a floating exchange rate and a free flow of capital is discussed.},

abstract = {This article intends to raise a discussion concerning the role and importance of financial dominance as a component that characterizes the existing regime of capital accumulation of the world economy. This approach has scarcely been included in the analysis of today's economic crisis that is impacting the world economy. The article also intends to show how the speculative financing of big enterprises has contributed to the crisis of the regime of financial dominance accumulation. A basic premise raised in this analysis is that large conglomerates try, at all costs, to offer expressive returns to their shareholders in exchange for financial resources granted by economic agents in the stock exchange markets-in other words, returns generated by "fictitious capital." Many emergent economies became loci for patrimonial and financial valorization. In Latin America, for example, the financial dominance accumulation regime is based mainly on the continuous growth of the public securities debt, backed by extremely high interest rates on government securities. It has resulted in an increase in the inflows of short-term capitals, which favored the appreciation of their national currencies. As a consequence, the Latin American emergent economies are experiencing a return to balance of payments deficits. In short, an increase in dependency and economic and political domination by the internationalized capital. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the macroeconomic and wealth effects of unconventional monetary policy. To this end, we estimate a Bayesian structural vector autoregression (B-SVAR) using U.S. monthly data for the post-Lehman Brothers' collapse period. We show that a positive shock to the growth rate of central bank reserves does not have a substantial impact on industrial production or consumer prices. However, it also gives a strong boost to asset prices, which is larger in magnitude for stock prices than for housing prices. Thus, unconventional monetary policy typically operates via portfolio-rebalancing effects. A VAR counterfactual exercise confirms the role of the shocks to the growth rate of central bank reserves in explaining the dynamics of the variables included in the system, especially in the case of asset prices. Finally, additional empirical assessments uncover an important change in the conduct of monetary policy from "standard" to "exceptional" times and the suitability of our model to capture such a structural transformation.},

abstract = {Validity is a key issue for consumers of computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling services. What assurance can producers of CGE results give to consumers that a CGE analysis: (i) is computationally sound, (ii) uses accurate up-to-date data, (iii) adequately captures behavioral and institutional characteristics of the relevant part of the economy, (iv) is consistent with history, and (v) is based on a model that has forecasting credentials? This chapter gives some answers. With regard to (i), CGE modelers have an obligation to conduct exhaustive test simulations. The value of these procedures goes beyond computational checking. Test simulations are a practical way to become familiar with a model and often reveal modeling weaknesses. On (ii) and (iii), the most effective approach for displaying the relevant data and describing what is going on is via a back-of-the-envelope (BOTE) model. A well-designed BOTE model has two properties: it reveals the roles of major behavioral, institutional and data assumptions in causing a model to generate a particular result; and it is small enough to be managed with pencil and paper (on the back of an envelope) and to be presented in a limited timeframe to policy advisors. On (iv) and (v), the chapter describes various aspects of statistical validation, concentrating mainly on historical simulation, baseline forecasting and the testing of baselines against reality. This work demonstrates that CGE models can produce forecasts at a highly disaggregated level that comfortably beat non-model-based trend forecasts. It also demonstrates that there is considerable potential for improved CGE forecasts through conscientious data work and improved methods for projecting trends from historical simulations into forecasting simulations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with housing, this paper shows that strong monetary reactions to accelerator mechanisms that push up credit growth and house prices can help macroeconomic stability. In addition, using a macroprudential instrument specifically designed to dampen credit market cycles would also provide stabilization benefits when an economy faces financial sector or housing demand shocks. However, the optimal macroprudential rule under productivity shocks is to not intervene. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the source of house price booms for the design of monetary and macroprudential policy.},

abstract = {This article concerns the corporate responses to the economic integration process from 1973 to 2008 in two small, open European countries, Denmark and Sweden. It focuses on strategic relations regarding the integration process and analyses the changing diversification patterns and internationalisation levels. The hypothesis from the economic integration literature indicates that we could expect a high degree of core business focus combined with a high degree of internationalisation concurrently with the economic integration process. The Danish case confirmed this prediction in a clear and substantial way, while the Swedish diversification pattern was marked by the continuous importance of diversification in the period from 1973 to 1993. This confirms the findings of Whittington and Mayer, who investigated the development of the largest British, French and German manufacturing enterprises. But the result also indicates that diversification perhaps proved to be less important after 1993 when the process of ‘Europeanisation' dynamics was succeeded by the globalisation processes including the fast growing economies in South East Asia.},

Although this argument has largely been discredited, the global financial crisis has revived the state-market debate. As governments succumb to fiscal consolidation, a similar theory of declining state capacity now challenges social democrats. This article redresses the contemporary situation by using the economic globalisation debate from the mid-1990s to 2005 as a lens through which to comparatively analyse the current fiscal policy positions of the Parti Socialiste and the Labour Party. It draws similarities between the two situations and illustrates how contested notions of the contemporary political economy constrain social democratic fiscal policy capacity, suggesting that greater capacity exists than is currently acknowledged.},

@phdthesis{Perrott2018,
abstract = {This dissertation examines the discursive production of new developments and the reinvention of suburban image in the municipalities arcing around the City of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Planning policies promoting densification, alongside rising housing prices, and persistent concerns about car-dependence, set the context for aspirations of urbanity in planning and development. Discourses analyzed include transcripts of interviews with housing and community producers (planners, municipal councillors, and developers), the planning policies produced by government, and the marketing materials produced by the development industry. Studies examining the historic planning and promotion of the suburbs have shown the prominence placed on symbolic distinction from the city with references to nature, rurality and countryside, where residents are promised a healthy retreat, privacy, safety, and an ideal place to raise children. This dissertation argues that suburban planning and housing marketing discourses in the Toronto region reveal an emerging reversal in the suburban script that downplays the urban-suburban distinction and promotes a more urbane place image, representing a case study of broader contemporary efforts to urbanize the suburbs.    In the first of three empirical papers, the research shows how stacked and back-to-back townhouses are planned and promoted by intertwining discourses of suburban "evolution" and "routes to maturity" through homeownership where smaller units offer a type of fix to market constraints, and young adults are produced as suburban-re-inventor subjects. The second paper demonstrates the importance of aesthetics and modern design in the discursive production of competitive and attractive world-class growth nodes and corridors as part of the ideological-political trajectory towards post-suburbanization. The third paper examines the gap that producers describe between the promises of compact city theory and the in-practice realities of car-dependence and separated land uses. While some marketing materials draw on the long-standing discursive production of the suburbs as the "best of both worlds," producers describe the contemporary suburbs as increasingly compact in residential areas, but still car-dependent leading to concerns about being "squished-in" and stuck in traffic. Practitioner perspectives on the successes and challenges of current strategies signal the need for additional theories and policies, beyond residential densification, to resolve the challenges of the suburbs.},

While Keynesians defend preemptive state intervention to avoid crises, neoclassical economics believe that the market will solve all problems without the need to resort to state action. After the Great Depression in 1930, Keynesian economics gained popularity, while neoclassical economics took over in the 1970s. Today, Keynesian economics became popular again in the aftermath of 2008 financial crisis. According to them, there is no alternative to the market system.

abstract = {In urban studies scholarship, Lebanon is often theorized on the frontiers of sectarian conflict as well as on the frontlines of neoliberalism. Entangling real estate investment, sovereign debt and transnational financial circulations from Arab Gulf investors and the Lebanese diaspora, managed by the Banque du Liban and scrutinized by the United States Treasury, the Lebanese political economy was—and still is—swayed by the fortunes of war. According to literature on the political economy of violence, profits are often made in times of war, a context appropriate to the civil war and postwar eras, during which spoils of war enriched the pockets of warlords-turned-politicians. Yet as the effects of the Syrian conflict spill across the border, encumbering Lebanon's long paralyzed politics, straining its already deteriorated infrastructure and intensifying uncertainty with punctuated bombings, certain sectors prosper not because of violence but in spite of it. The skyline of Beirut is covered in construction cranes erecting affluent, if empty, apartments; the banks are infused with deposits invested in the debt of a sovereign bankrupt in ways not simply financial. Both real estate and banking are said to be resilient, a discourse so often repeated that resilience has become the dominant mode by which Lebanon is broadly understood, and not only by the developers and bankers with a financial interest in this depiction. Resilience has taken on the status of a self-evident truth. Tracing transnational investment into these two sectors, the pillars of the economy, this dissertation excavates the history around which resilience arose as a concept and thereafter endured. Rather than a description or explanation, resilience is instead—this dissertation argues—a dispositif organizing an entire political economy around the attraction of foreign financial inflows and ongoing emigration, ensuring the resilience for which Lebanon is renowned also perpetuates much of its underlying instability.},

abstract = {The European banking and sovereign debt crisis has revealed severe financial imbalances among countries and institutional sectors. In reaction, economic policy and theory has focused on the role of finance in mitigating economic imbalances and finding ways to deal with them. Policy makers launched data gap initiatives to enhance economic and financial statistics, an important pillar of these initiatives being the integrated framework of the System of National Accounts, unifying product, income, capital, and financial accounts. In this framework, there are elaborated Stock-Flow Consistent models that model any interconnections of institutional sectors, in both real and financial aspects, in a consistent way. This article aims to illustrate the principles and possibilities of Stock Flow Consistent models and their relation to the System of National Acounts. To accomplish this, we construct a simplified Stock Flow Consistent model applied to the sectoral (im)balances between the private, government, and foreign sectors, which were a notable feature of the recent European crisis. {\textcopyright} 2017-Center for Economic Integration, Sejong Institution, Sejong University.},

This dilemma has become particularly acute for programme countries that were either directly or indirectly in receipt of non-market financial fundingfrom the troika. Drawing upon a new international political economy approach to comparative political economy, this article argues that joining together two distinct macroeconomic growth regimes is the real source of the euro crisis: domestic demand-led models, which predominate in southern Europe, and export-led models, which dominate the landscape of northern Europe. European policymakers assume that all member states can converge on an export-led model of growth. This vision of convergence is exacerbating rather than resolving the imbalance of capitalisms at the heart of the Eurozone.},

@article{Bhatt1971,
abstract = {Overall balance between expected available resources and planned investment is not sufficient to ensure development with stability. Imbalances and inflationary pressures could develop as a result of inconsistencies between sector‐wise investment structure and the sector‐wise structure of saving. This means that the dichotomy between real and financial planning needs to be eliminated not only at the national level but at the sectoral levels as well, so that the sector‐wise investment pattern is consistent with the emerging structure of saving and the flow‐of‐funds. This presents an analysis of the structure of saving and flow‐of‐funds in India, shows how it is actually used for the purpose of financial planning, and attempts to derive a formalized technique of financial planning. Analysis of the structure of saving in India during 1954–1955 to 1967–1968 indicates the importance of the household sector as the net lending sector to the borrowing sectors, the government and the private corporate sectors. On the basis of the feasible sectoral rates of growth in income and the past trends in sectoral saving‐income ratios and household saving pattern with such modifications as are necessary in the light of expected changes in various policies, sector‐wise saving structure and the pattern of household sector saving are projected for the Fourth Plan period (1969–1974). Then a flow‐of‐funds matrix is prepared to derive sector‐wise investment estimates as are consistent with the estimated structure of saving and the likely changes in the lending policies of the financial institutions. A formalized technique of financial planning based on the Indian planning experience is presented in the last section of the paper. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1971, Wiley Blackwell.

Both the Iran and Sri Lanka SAMs were constructed within the context of the International Labour Office, World Employment Programme: that for Iran was intended as a contribution to the work of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy Mission to Iran under WEP auspices; while the Sri Lanka SAM was more specifically a research oriented study. The Swaziland study was financed by the Overseas Development Ministry, London as a research activity.

have increasingly been constrained - also due to their large foreign
exposures.
Traditional macroeconomic models cannot analyse this phenomenon
appropriately as they lack a proper model of the financial sector and
underestimate the potential for interactions between the monetary and
the real sphere. We present a stock-flow consistent approach developed

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the endogenous nature of money. Contrary to the established post-Keynesian, or evolutionary, view, this paper argues that money has always been endogenous, irrespective of the historical period. Instead of the evolutionary theory of money and banking that can be traced back to Chick (1986), this paper puts forward a revolu- tionary definition of endogenous money consistent with many aspects of post-Keynesian eco- nomics as well as with the monetary circuit approach. This alternative starting point leads to the conclusion that money is indeed ‘always and everywhere' an endogenous phenomenon. This analysis rests on the nature of debt, the essential role of a settlement institution, and the link between production, money and income.},

abstract = {The credit default swap (CDS) is implicated in the global financial crises because a vast market for securities collateralized by subprime mortgages and consumer debt could not have materialized if hedge funds and other holders of these instruments lacked a means of hedging default "risk." The argument is made that the CDS is an inherently defective concept because it is based on the assumption that future states of the economy are subject to probabilistic risk as opposed to uncertainty in the Keynes-Knight-Shackle-Davidson sense. The CDS also manifests the paradox of derivatives. By enabling individual money managers to safely increase leverage, it causes a system-wide buildup of leverage and financial fragility.

abstract = {Hyman Minsky's analysis of the predisposition of capitalistic economies like the US to periods of hyperactivity and fragility in their financial markets is relatively straightforward. The point of departure is to note that while mainstream theory attributes macroeconomic fluctuations to exogenous disturbances that impact on decentralized markets, for Minsky instability is attributable to endogenous events of capitalist finance. Beginning from a state of relative tranquility, the stage is set for an investment expansion if an economy encounters a major fortuitous circumstance (which has historically been an energy revolution) that spurs the animal spirits of its businessmen. Much has been written about the transformation of production processes by IT. Substantially less has been written about the impact of IT on the economy's organizational and financial institutions and markets.},

abstract = {Goodwin cycles result from the dynamic interaction between a profit-led demand regime and a reserve army effect in income distribution. The paper proposes the concept of a pseudo- Goodwin cycle. We define this as a counter-clockwise movement in output and wage share space which is not generated by the usual Goodwin mechanism. In particular, it does not depend on a profit-led demand regime. As a demonstration, a simple Minsky model is extended by adding a reserve army distribution adjustment mechanism. The wage share responds positively to output but generates no feedback. In the augmented Minsky model, cycles are generated purely through the interaction between financial fragility and demand. By design, demand is not influenced by changes in income distribution. But the model does exhibit a pseudo-Goodwin cycle in the output-wage share space. This holds true even if a wage-led demand regime is introduced. This demonstrates that the existence of a counter-clockwise movement of output and the wage share cannot be regarded as proof of the existence of a Goodwin cycle and a profit-led demand regime.},

It is argued that Babylonian thought is one way of understanding Keynes's "ordinary logic," while Davidson's use of the term "axiomatic" appears problematic. But the ergodic axiom is so compatible with the open-systems ontology on which Babylonian thought is based that there is, in fact, scope for broad agreement.},

abstract = {This article analyses how easily accessible financialised consumer credit changes the social character of money as such. It is clear that contemporary consumer credit markets entail dangers of increasing levels of over-indebtedness, as well as opportunities for the growing economic independence of citizens. Financialised consumer credit is characterised by three factors: complex regulation, the option of resale of debts, and high costs for the customer. My main argument is that the consequences of financialised consumer credit markets can be governed by arranging institutions properly. In other words, it is argued that financialised consumer credit is neither good nor bad in general, but that its social acceptability will be the outcome of a complex regulatory arrangement. To demonstrate the options of such an arrangement, this article investigates the market conditions in Germany and compares them to some features of Poland. / Przedmiotem analizy jest spos{\'{o}}b, w jaki latwo dost{\c{c}}pny, sfinansjalizowany kredyt konsumencki zmienia spoleczny charakter pieni{\^{}}dza jako takiego.

abstract = {From the late 1980s on, many western governments discovered that they will face a major fiscal crisis by the middle decades of this century. They have drawn this conclusion based on forecasts of demographic change, economic growth and public sector deficit dynamics. At least twenty seven countries are now engaging in what is called variously 'generational accounting', or 'intergenerational accounting'. The predictions about looming fiscal crisis rely on the proposition that the demographic structure of most developed societies is changing because of an unprecedented increase in both the numbers and proportion of elderly people. Some governments have concluded that long-term fiscal sustainability needs to be defined as the policy problem. The article begins by summarizing the core features of the generational accounting framework. It then briefly outlines some of the propositions advanced by those promoting a monetary macroeconomic framework.},

An increase in income inequality and the current account deficit and a consolidation of the government budget lead to a decrease in the saving rate of the household sector. Such a process is unsustainable because it leads to an increase in the debt-to-income ratio of the households and its maintenance depends on some kind of asset bubble.

financial sector as shown in the existing literature. We underline how
the structure of the financial sector itself could impact the carbon
trend of the economy. We then see how these specific linkages between
the financial and the climate sector can be represented in new types of
IAMs, and how they have already started to be addressed, notably in the
stock-flow consistent models literature. We conclude on the necessary
convergence agenda between climate policies addressing the financial

The intended contributions of the paper are twofold: it extends the Kaleckian model for an open economy to incorporate the effects of capital flows on the RER and interest rate, and it acknowledges the possibility of having different macroeconomic regimes that reflect different preferences for inflation and employment by the government. A monetary rule that considers its effects on both inflation and employment may be more conducive to stability than a regime that solely focuses on inflation. On the other hand, a regime that solely focuses on employment will be unstable if adaptive expectations prevail in the process of wage bargaining.},

abstract = {The paper seeks to distinguish between two broad perspectives on financialization. The first takes the view that financialization relates to the growth of the financial sector in its operations, power, etc. On that basis, financialization has been proceeding with ups and downs for possibly thousands of years. The specific forms financialization may have taken in the past few decades are outlined. The findings from mainstream economics literature on one aspect of financialization (growth of bank deposits, growth of stock markets) and economic growth are reviewed. The second perspective views financialization (financialized capitalism) as a stage or epoch of capitalism dating from circa 1980. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {An expanding literature analyses the implications of the post-1980 expansion of finance in advanced economies – a process summarized as ‘financialization' – for capital accumulation. This paper surveys the empirical literature on financialization and investment to take stock of where we are and to identify questions for further research. Because ‘financialization' is widely recognized to be ambiguously defined, I first introduce empirical indicators of financialization in this literature. This categorization elucidates three approaches to measuring financialization in the context of investment. The first two approaches emphasize rising income flows between nonfinancial corporations (NFCs) and finance: first, growth in NFCs' financial incomes and, second, growth in NFCs' payments to creditors and shareholders. Rising financial profits are, notably, widely used to suggest financial assets and incomes ‘crowd out' physical investment. I contend that these flow-based indicators of financialization capture important relationships between changes in firm financial behaviour and investment, but also raise questions about determinants underlying NFCs' changing portfolio and financing decisions. The third approach to defining financialization emphasizes the best-developed behavioural explanation linking financialization to reduced investment: shareholder value orientation. In future research, scope remains for further attention to behavioural drivers of the empirical trends summarizing financialization. {\textcopyright} 2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

Swedish time series show that the age structure contains information correlated to medium-term trends in growth and inflation. GDP gaps estimated by age structure regressions are closely related to conventional measures. Monetary policy is believed to affect inflation with a lag of 1 or 2 years. Projections of the population's age structure are comparatively reliable several years ahead and provide additional information to improve on 3-5 years-ahead forecasts of potential GDP and inflation. Thus there is a potential scope for using age structure based forecasts as an aid to monetary policy formation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {This paper investigates how monetary policy should be conducted in a two-region general equilibrium model with monopolistic competition and price stickiness. This framework delivers a simple welfare criterion based on the utility of the consumers that can be used to evaluate monetary policy in a currency area. If the two regions share the same degree of nominal rigidity, the terms of trade are completely insulated from monetary policy and the optimal outcome is obtained by targeting a weighted average of the regional inflation rates. These weights coincide with the economic sizes of the region. If the degrees of rigidity are different, the optimal plan implies a high degree of inertia in the inflation rate. But an inflation targeting policy in which higher weight is given to the inflation in the region with higher degree of nominal rigidity is nearly optimal.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V. In this paper, we build a dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model with housing and household debt, and compare the effectiveness of monetary policy, housing-related fiscal policy, and macroprudential regulations in reducing household indebtedness. Excessive household debt arises due to exuberance shocks on house price expectations, which drive a wedge between the actual and the underlying fundamental value of houses. The estimated model also features long-term fixed-rate borrowing and lending across two types of households, and differentiates between the flow and the stock of household debt. Our main findings can be summarized as follows: (i) Monetary tightening is able to reduce the stock of real mortgage debt, but leads to an increase in the household debt-to-income ratio. (ii) Among the policy tools we consider, tightening in mortgage interest deduction and regulatory loan-to-value (LTV) are the most effective and least costly in reducing household debt, followed by increasing property taxes and monetary tightening. (iii) Although mortgage interest deduction is a broader tool than regulatory LTV, and therefore potentially more costly in terms of output loss, it is effective in reducing overall mortgage debt, since its direct reach also extends to home equity loans. (iv) Lowering regulatory LTV and mortgage interest deductions from their current levels would be welfare improving, while we find weak support for systematic leaning against household imbalances through monetary policy.},

@misc{Wray2012,
abstract = {It is commonplace to link neoclassical economics to 18th-or 19th-century physics and its notion of equilibrium, of a pendulum once disturbed eventually coming to rest. Likewise, an economy subjected to an exogenous shock seeks equilibrium through the stabilizing market forces unleashed by the invisible hand. The metaphor can be applied to virtually every sphere of economics: from micro markets for fish that are traded spot, to macro markets for something called labor, and on to complex financial markets in synthetic collateralized debt obligations-CDOs. Guided by invisible hands, supplies balance demands and markets clear. Armed with metaphors from physics, the economist has no problem at all extending the analysis across international borders to traded commodities, to what are euphemistically called capital flows, and on to currencies themselves. Certainly there is a price, somewhere, somehow, that will balance supply and demand. The orthodox economist is sure that if we just get the government out of the way, the market will do the dirty work. The heterodox economist? Well, she is less sure. The market might not work. It needs a bit of coaxing. Imbalances can persist. Market forces can be rather impotent. The visible hand of government can hasten the move toward balance. Orthodox economists as well as most heterodox economists see the Global Financial Crisis as a consequence of domestic and global imbalances. The most common story blames the US Federal Reserve for excessive monetary ease that spurred borrowing, and the US fiscal and trade imbalances for a surplus of liquidity sloshing around global financial markets. Looking to the specific problems in Euroland, the imbalances are attributed to profligate Mediterraneans. The solution is to restore global balance, which requires some combination of higher exchange rates for the Chinese, reduction of US trade deficits, and Teutonic fiscal discipline in the United States, the UK, and Japan, as well as on the periphery of Europe. This paper takes an alternative view, following the sectoral balances approach of Wynne Godley, combined with the modern money theory (MMT) approach derived from the work of Innes, Knapp, Keynes, Lerner, and Minsky. The problem is not one of financial imbalance, but rather one of an imbalance of power. There is too much power in the hands of the financial sector, money managers, the predator state, and Europe's center. There is too much privatization and pursuit of the private purpose, and too little use of government to serve the public interest. In short, there is too much neoliberalism and too little democracy, transparency, and accountability of government.},

The current study centres on a critical review of available literature and a contribution to the substantive topics indicated in the title. The objective is to examine relevant empirical and theoretical studies. The study argues that following the adoption of capital liberalisation and neoliberalism, the economies of most developing countries have become more vulnerable. If China is excluded, we find that most developing economies have been unable to expand employment opportunities or reduce levels of poverty due to fear of capital flight. In recent years, capital liberalisation policy has encouraged capital flight from their economies. After 2008, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) publicly express support for capital controls as a result of the global financial crisis and as the vulnerabilities associated with capital flows.},

We consider a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with housing and collateral constraints. A macroprudential rule for the loan-to-value ratio (LTV), which responds to credit growth, interacts with a traditional Taylor rule for monetary policy. We compute the optimal parameters of these rules both when monetary and macroprudential policies act in a coordinated and in a non-coordinated way. We find that both policies acting together unambiguously improves the stability of the system. In both cases, this interaction is welfare improving for the society, especially in the case of the non-coordinated game. There is though a trade-off between borrowers and savers. However, borrowers can compensate the saver's welfare loss aỳ la Kaldor-Hicks to achieve a Pareto-superior outcome.},

abstract = {In this dissertation I analyze an institutional investor portfolio of over-leveraged multifamily rental housing in East Palo Alto, California to demonstrate how changing forms of landlordism produce both new and familiar targets for tenants organizing against displacement and for housing security. Venture capital investors in the first decade of the 2000s exploited the Silicon Valley regional conditions of racial exclusion, uneven development, and municipal rent control. I introduce the legacy of Black political organization in East Palo Alto as a way of contextualizing the tenants' and the city leaders' response to the monopoly investment purchase. The structure of this rental portfolio demonstrates the multiple actors involved in such large-scale residential investments, including institutional state pension funds, high-net worth individuals, local and international lenders, money managers, and the Security and Exchange Commission. The case study analysis considers how tenants, advocates, and a local union representing shareholders in the country's largest pension, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), mobilized city and state officials to exert influence over these targets, focusing on the institutional investor in particular, albeit with limited success.   This case finds that venture capital investors backed by public pension funds exacerbated the escalating renter crisis in East Palo Alto, and elsewhere. I suggest that the findings from this case study, particularly those detailing the points of leverage available to tenants to target public pension funds, as well as the power of cities, bear lessons for tenants organizing in other large-scale multifamily rental portfolios and bundled scattered site single-family real estate owned (REO) foreclosure-to-rental portfolios. The analysis concludes by drawing from principles of housing security and offering what a coalitional, labor/community, racial justice politics for “the right to the city” might entail when taking into account changing conditions of investor landlordism.},

abstract = {Our paper investigates the impact of rising inequality in a two-country macroeconomic model with an agent-based household sector characterized by peer effects in consumption. In particular, the model highlights the role of inequality in determining diverging balance of payments dynamics within a currency union. Inequality may drive the two countries into different growth patterns: where peer effects in consumption interact with higher credit availability, rising income inequality leads to the emergence of a debt-led growth. Where social norms determine weaker emulation and credit availability is lower, an export-led regime arises. Eventually, a crisis emerges endogenously due to the sudden-stop of capital flows from the net lending country, triggered by the excessive risk associated with the dramatic amount of private debt accumulated by households in the borrowing country. Monte Carlo simulations for a wide range of calibrations confirm the robustness of our results.},

abstract = {The German debt brake is often regarded as a great success story and has therefore served as a role model for the Euro area and it's Fiscal Compact. In this paper we fundamentally criticise the debt brake. Firstly, we show that it suffers from serious shortcomings and that its success is far from certain even from a mainstream point of view. Secondly, we show that, from a Post-Keynesian perspective, the debt brake completely neglects the requirements for fiscal policies of member countries in a currency union like the Euro area. It will prevent fiscal policy from contributing to the necessary rebalancing in the Euro area. Thirdly, we show that alternative scenarios, which could avoid the deflationary pressures of the German Debt Brake on domestic demand and contribute to internally rebalancing the Euro area, are extremely unlikely as they would have to rely on unrealistic shifts in the functional income distribution and/or investment and savings behaviour in Germany.

abstract = {Although the finance-growth relationship is now firmly entrenched in the empirical literature, we show that it is not as strong in more recent data as it was in the original studies with data for the period from 1960 to 1989. We consider several explanations. First, we find that the incidence of financial crises is related to the dampening of the effect of financial deepening on growth. Excessive financial deepening or too rapid a growth of credit may have led to both inflation and weakened banking systems which in turn gave rise to growth-inhibiting financial crises. Excessive financial deepening may also be a result of widespread financial liberalizations in the late 1980s and early 1990s in countries that lacked the legal or regulatory infrastructure to exploit financial development successfully. However, we find little indication that liberalizations played an important direct role in reducing the effect of finance. Similarly, there is little evidence that the growth of equity mar},

There are a number of plausible explanations for the empirical evidence that profit rates do not converge between sectors, regions, and nations.  Compensating differentials for risk, differences in tax and regulatory policy, and interaction among sectors have all been proposed.  This model does not consider any of these plausible explanations for nonconvergence.  Instead capital moves strictly according to differences in the rates of return.  The novelty of this model is that it explicitly accounts for income flow generated by cross-border capital ownership and their consequence for demand and aggregate profits.  These income flows can benefit profit rate convergence, even when converge is embedded into the structure of the model by explicitly competitive capital flows.},

In our model, workers first make consumption decisions based on their gross income, and then treat debt servicing commitments as a substitute for saving. Workers' borrowing is induced by their desire to keep up with the consumption standard set by rentiers' consumption, reflecting an aspect of the relative income hypothesis. As a result of this consumption and debt servicing behavior, consumer debt accumulation and income distribution have effects on aggregate demand, profitability, and economic growth that differ from those found in existing models. We also investigate the financial sustainability of the Golden Age and Neoliberal growth regimes within our framework. It is shown that distributional changes between the Golden Age and the Neoliberal regimes, together with corresponding changes in consumption emulation behavior via expenditure cascades, suffice to make the Neoliberal growth regime unsustainable.},

The article argues the basic reason for the failure is a deficient conceptual apparatus that fails to account for the role of credit, debt, asset prices, the growing weight of speculative investment, and financial variables in general. The article maintains that a similar conceptual deficiency has prevented Marxist economists in recent years from adequately understanding and predicting the continuing global economic crisis. The article argues that changes in global financial structure, financial institutions, and financial markets in 21st-century global Capitalism have rendered Marx's 19th-century view of money, credit and banking insufficient. Marxist economic analysis thus needs to develop a more complete conceptual apparatus if it is to more adequately account for the disruptive role of finance capital in the 21st century.},

Taking into consideration continuing capitalist variety among national political economies of the Eurozone, I examine the implications of EMU for the macroeconomic autonomy of different national models capitalism. Drawing on a comparative capitalism perspective, it is argued that the Eurozone's coordinated market economies - Germany in particular - have gained much more from the introduction of the euro in terms of monetary power than the other models. This argument will be based on an analysis of two key dimensions of EMU's macroeconomic governance regime: (1) exchange rate policymaking; and (2) the management of balance-of-payments.

abstract = {We study the effects of loans and mortgages securitization on business
cycles by using a large-scale agent-based stock-flow consistent
macroeconomic model and simulator. We enriched the model by including a
financial vehicle corporation, which buys loans and mortgages from banks
and issues asset-backed securities (ABSs) and mortgage-backed securities
(MBSs), and a mutual fund, which invests both in ABSs and MBSs using its
liquidity resources and issues new shares when in liquidity shortage.
Households own the equity of the mutual fund in the form of equity
shares. By means of securitization, banks conduct regulatory capital
arbitrage and reduce risk-weighted assets in their balance sheet, thus
being able to lend more loans and mortgages. Results show that different
levels of securitization propensity are able to affect credit and
business cycles in different manners. On one side, securitization
increases banks' lending activity, influencing positively investment and
consumption. On the other side, the increased amount of credit amplifies
negative shocks, due to higher loans' write-offs probability triggered
by the boosted lending activity. Firms' bankruptcies impact the equity
of banks, affecting their ability to grant new loans to consumption
goods producers (CGPs), which need credit for their production activity,
and mortgages to households, which need them to purchase housing units.
The effect of securitization on the economy critically depends on the
level of securitization propensity and on the time span considered.},

abstract = {Various examples of complementary currencies have recently emerged in Europe in response to the impact of the 2007 financial crisis. They have been variously labelled as social, local and alternative money but their economic meaning has still to be discussed. On the one hand, they have been hailed as innovative tools for socioterritorial policies with a focus on localist, anti-globalist and anti-capitalist values. On the other, the emphasis on the value of currencies as instruments of alternative territorial development runs the risk of overshadowing issues concerning the specific features of such projects. The first part of this paper puts forward an interpretation of the current situation as a crisis of the liquidity principle and suggests that the principle of clearing instead represents the primary point of reference for any institutional arrangement aimed at restoring a balanced relationship between lenders and borrowers. A critical review of known European complementary monetary circuits is followed by examination of the Sardex clearing system. The paper then goes on to argue by means of a stock-flow consistent model that complementary monetary circuits can serve to stabilise local economic systems. In particular, a local clearing union for local exchanges has the effect of stabilising the profits of firms while attenuating the impact of the credit crunch at same time. {\textcopyright} The Author 2016.},

in the 2007-2008 crisis, agent-based models are widely considered a
promising alternative to current macroeconomic research dominated by
DSGE models. Their failure is commonly interpreted as a failure to
incorporate heterogeneous interacting agents. This paper explains that
complex behavior and sudden transitions also arise from the economy's
financial structure as reflected in its balance sheets, not just from
heterogeneous interacting agents. It introduces ``flow-of-funds{\{}''{\}} or
``accounting{\{}''{\}} models, which were pre eminent in successful
anticipations of the recent crisis. In illustration, a simple balance
sheet model of the economy is developed to demonstrate that non-linear
behavior and sudden transition may arise from the economy's balance
sheet structure, even without any micro-foundations. The paper concludes
by discussing one recent example of combining flow-of-funds and
agent-based models. This appears a promising avenue for future research.},

It addresses the main differences between the orthodox, heterodox and MMT approaches to monetary theory while reconciling endogenous money theory with the state money approach. By emphasising the symmetry between how banks create money as they finance private spending and how the government creates money when it finances its own spending, we clarify some of the misconceptions surrounding MMT while showing that it is more consistent with the facts of experience. Furthermore, we argue that MMT's insistence that government spending or lending must precede bond sales is consistent with the Keynesian emphasis on effective demand as the driving force behind income and saving. We delve into MMT's implications for monetary and fiscal policy, with a particular focus on the eurozone. We conclude our paper by discussing two proposals of ‘monetary cranks': narrow banking and government issue of debt-free money. This allows us to re-emphasise MMT's views on the nature of money.},

abstract = {According to portfolio managers, agriculture in general, and farmland in particular, can be considered an emerging asset class. Specialized financial vehicles, such as private equity and mutual funds, are emerging and competing to attract potential investment in this asset class. In recent years, there has been significant development of such vehicles targeting South Africa's farming sector. These innovations are led by a group of market intermediaries (e.g. asset managers or consultants) who endeavour to "re-shape" South African farmland as an opportunity for institutional investors. These "pioneers" engage in a multifaceted mediation process between global financial investors on one hand, and the South African agricultural sector on the other. Drawing upon an empirical study of such intermediaries in South Africa, this paper analyses the concrete mechanisms that facilitate this particular form of commodification. The paper presents and compares the intermediaries, giving particular attention to their structure, governance mechanisms and asset allocations within this "market in the making". It describes how intermediaries develop different paths of asset valorization to unlock the "financial value" of South African farmlands (i.e. "liquifying", standardizing, neutralizing, and depoliticizing agriculture as an asset). But, it also highlights some of the difficulties faced in the process of translating between international investors and local managers, questioning the "land-asset fiction" that is materializing through the subordination of farmland to the needs of financial society.},

It zooms in on the regional level and provides and systemic and macrostructural analysis of the factors that account an increase in finance and insurance activities. Theoretically, the argument highlights the crucial importance of various forms of indebtedness as the social, economic and political relationship that constitutes financialization processes. Empirically, the paper stresses the sub-national dimension and thus contributes to fill an important, yet largely underappreciated gap in the political economy of finance. In order to fully grasp the extent to which financialization has transformed capitalism throughout the last three decades, it seems indispensable to include regions into the analysis. By injecting geography into the political economic debate, the paper might animate future research and a renewed discussion on regional specificities.},

This change leads to the formation of a deflationary spiral. Aggregate activity decreases and unemployment increases. The macroeconomic stability of the model is affected and eventually a systemic crisis arises. Finally, we show that the introduction of a minimum wage would have made it possible to boost the aggregate demand and to avoid this crisis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {The emergence and persistence of large trade imbalances as well as the volatility of financial flows among countries have been attributed, at least in part, to the inadequacy of the current international monetary system after the breakdown of Bretton Woods. From a different perspective, the current eurozone crisis is also the result, in our view, of a flawed institutional setting. These problems call for reforms to mitigate or avoid the recessionary bias that is the outcome of current systems, as Keynes predicted in the discussion preceding the Bretton Woods agreements. In this paper we briefly review the evidence on international imbalances, and survey the rapidly growing literature on the subject. We introduce a set of models based on the stock-flow-consistent approach pioneered by Godley (1999) and Lavoie and Godley (2003). We discuss how to use these models to explore potential reform of the international monetary system. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Globalized economy has brought about many economic and political problems in both national and international fields. One of the most significant results of globalization is that it has removed boundaries and reduced time and space related costs preventing international capital from moving towards areas where it can increase its value. This change, which is positive considering revaluation and profit increase in global capital, has caused normlessness and led to a process blocking international competition, which may most of the time result in national and international economic crises. Countries have, thus, started to introduce tax policies that would attract global capital. This problem has conceptually been handled in fiscal literature as international tax competition. Recently its harmful aspects have also been included in the discussions. In this context, national authorities as well as international institutions such as European Union and OECD have been working on projects to prevent harmful tax competition. Yet, globalization and financialization of economy have made countries more dependent on international capital. It is conflicting that countries are making new regulations to prevent harmful tax competitions while they are also creating an environment where they can promote global capital to avoid possible financial crises. This conflict was clearly observed in European Union during the 2008 global crisis. This study reveals the conflict between tax policies applied by EU to overcome the 2008 global financial crisis and the works intended for preventing harmful tax competition in EU.},

That's the starting point. It's a truism, basically. Where it goes from being a truism and an accounting identity to an economic relationship is once you recognize that cyclical impulses to the economy depend on desired changes in these sector's financial balances... If the business sector is basically trying to reduce its financial surplus at a more rapid pace than the government is trying to reduce its deficit then you're getting a net positive impulse to spending which then translates into stronger, higher, more income, and ultimately feeds back into spending.},

abstract = {This dissertation anthropologically examines a law for personal insolvency passed by the Greek Parliament in 2010. It assembles a lexicon of concepts involved in the formulation and implementation of insolvency law in Greece over the last 8 years. Some of these concepts are written into the law while others have been generated as interpretations and are observed as ethnographic findings. The law protected most borrowers from loan enforcement and suspended auctions of homes, permitting demands for financial security beyond those traditionally assigned to insolvency law. The notion of financial security has been repeatedly redefined and extended due to uncertainty about housing values, under pressure from voters, and through abstentions from work by lawyers and notaries. Through long-term fieldwork in Athens and extensive archival research, this dissertation is an examination of the grooves to which the law was fit, the kinds of cases it enables, and the new legal contexts which it has shaped. It engages with legal and economic knowledge about the permanent inability to pay debts, describing what happens when liquidity is arrested and the things one has can no longer be exchanged for the things one needs.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the application of a model similar to the one developed in Leif Johansen's Multi-sectoral study of economic growth (1964) to the problem of determining general equilibrium responses of the economy to changes in commercial policy. This method amounts essentially to specifying a log-linear approximation to the general equilibrium solution for the economy, and solving the resulting linear equations for changes in endogenous variables as functions of exogenous variable changes. For a 35-sector model of the Chilean economy with labor as the only variable factor of production (to avoid the problem of overdetermination of many commodity price and output shifts when only two factors are considered in constant returns production functions), it is found that (i) the specification of the way in which intermediate inputs enter the production function is numerically important in determining output responses to tariff changes, detracting from the credibility of fixed coefficient effective rate of protection calculations if variable intermediate input coefficients are the rule (as appears likely empirically); (ii) exchange rate elasticities with respect to individual tariff changes are fairly large, so that the usual partial equilibrium assumption of exchange rate insensitivity to 'small' tariff revisions is not valid; (iii) employment effects of different tariff revisions are highly variable and in some cases substantial. {\textcopyright} 1974.},

The expansion has been generated by economic processes that are unsustainable--processes in private saving, private borrowing, and asset prices that have fueled the growth of demand against a negative impetus both from fiscal policy and from net export demand. Given unchanged fiscal policy and the consensus forecast for growth in the rest of the world, continued expansion requires that private expenditure continue to expand relative to income on a record and growing scale, and it seems impossible that this source of growth can be forthcoming indefinitely, although it may well continue into next year. When private demand falters, it will be necessary to bring about a substantial relaxation of fiscal policy and to ensure that there is a structural improvement in the United States's balance of payments.},

abstract = {In this paper we discuss the relationship between the current account rebalancing in the Eurozone, income distribution and wage policies with a focus on the main surplus economy, Germany. We will illustrate how and to which extent German wage policies could be able to contribute to a more balanced development of the Eurozone and to overcome the export-led mercantilist German model. Our analysis and our scenarios will be based on stylized econometric results for Germany, as they have recently been obtained in the empirical literature estimating the German demand and growth regime based on post-Kaleckian models. We will focus in particular on the relationship between nominal wages and functional income distribution, on the one hand, and between functional income distribution and domestic demand, on the other hand. We show that more expansionary wage policy can contribute to reducing the excessive German current account surplus, mainly through the domestic income-imports channel. However, wage policy alone will be overburdened with the task of rebalancing. For this, in particular more expansionary fiscal policies are required. JEL: E21, E25, E27, E62, E64, F45, F47, H62},

However, all these quantitative projections stem from the same trade model, which assumes full employment and neutral (if not constant) income distribution in all countries, excluding from the outset any of the major risks of deeper liberalization. This lack of intellectual diversity and of realism shrouding the debate around CETA's alleged economic benefits calls for an alternative assessment grounded in more realistic modeling premises. In this paper, we provide alternative projections of CETA's economic effects using the United Nations Global Policy Model (GPM). Allowing for changes in employment and income distribution, we obtain very different results. In contrast to positive outcomes projected with full-employment models, we find CETA will lead to intra-EU trade diversion. More importantly, in the current context of tepid economic growth, competitive pressures induced by CETA will cause unemployment, inequality, and welfare losses. At a minimum, this shows that official studies do not offer a solid basis for an informed decision on CETA. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

abstract = {The 2007/2008 crisis revealed the inefficiency of markets' self-adjustment mechanisms and the inability of related regulatory policies to keep markets on a consistent path. Something went wrong with the free market myth. From this perspective, the paper brings to the fore the regulatory roots of the crisis and highlights the importance of the cognitive bias as well as the incompatibility between micro-rationality and macro-stability in the occurrence of crises. It then analyzes the endogenous instability of finance-led capitalism in a Minskyian vein to point out the crucial role of regulatory structures for macro-stability. The paper then argues that financial stability calls for fundamental modifications of the institutional structure of markets and for new policy principles. Macro-prudential regulation must replace market-oriented supervisory approaches to prevent short-sighted speculative activities and to direct financial markets toward funding productive activities in ways other than though neoclassical market-based incentives.

abstract = {This dissertation focuses on the theoretical and empirical causes and consequences of the financialization of the business enterprise. The first chapter argues that the transition from the Post-War SSA to the Contemporary SSA was accompanied by a paradigm shift in in the field of economics from the Keynesian/institutionalist to the neoliberal paradigm. Simultaneously, the nexus of contracts definition replaced the resource-based definition as the dominant paradigm of the economic theory of the firm. The second part of the first chapter documents how this ontological shift permeated the fields of law, theories of management, and strategy. The second chapter of this dissertation examines the transmission mechanism through which the theoretical assumptions of neoclassical agency theory influenced reality. The second chapter studies the diffusion of agency theory into corporate practice as an example of how theory can simultaneously be impacted by and have an impact on the world. The third chapter provides a review of the literature and recent trends on the relationship between institutional ownership and investment and develops the hypotheses for our meta-analysis. The fourth chapter conducts a meta-analysis of the relationship between institutional ownership and corporate investment behavior. The analysis in the fourth chapter also examines the role of the financial structure on the institutional ownership—corporate investment relationship. The fifth chapter concludes the dissertation, provides some theoretical and policy implications, and suggests avenues for future research.},

abstract = {Abstract The global financial crisis has reaffirmed the importance of financial factors for macroeconomic fluctuations. Recent work has shown how the conventional pre-crisis prescription that monetary policy should pay no attention to financial variables over and above their effects on inflation may no longer be valid in models that consider frictions in financial intermediation (C{\'{u}}rdia and Woodford, 2009). This paper analyzes whether Taylor rules augmented with asset prices and credit can improve upon a standard rule both in terms of macroeconomic stabilization and of agents׳ welfare in a DSGE with both a firms׳ balance-sheet channel and a bank-lending channel and in which the spread between lending and policy rates endogenously depends on banks׳ leverage. The main result is that, even in a model in which financial stability does not represent a distinctive policy objective, leaning-against-the-wind policies are desirable in the case of supply side shocks, while strict inflation targeting and a standard rule are less effective. The gains are amplified if the economy is characterized by high private sector indebtedness. Robustness shows that the interaction between financial frictions and debt-deflation effects is potentially very powerful.},

The main aim of the first section of this paper is to compare the SGP before and after the Six-pack reform in order to determine whether the reform has contributed to conformity of the SGP with theoretical requirements on fiscal rules, as defined by Kopits and Symansky (1998). According to our analysis, it could be concluded that the Six-pack reform has contributed to better fiscal regulation in the EU compared with theoretical requirements. Enforceability in real conditions, nonetheless, still depends on political will. The second section deals with the two recent British fiscal rules, which are also analysed using the Kopits and Symansky framework. The analysis of Eurozone and British fiscal rules aims at contributing to the current discussions about the economic consequences of Brexit.},

abstract = {This dissertation consists of three chapters...   Chapter 1: Aggregate Wealth and Its Distribution as Determinants of Financial Crises: Panel Evidence This essay investigates the relationship between wealth inequality and financial crises across a panel of nine advanced economies over the past 100 years. While substantiation of a role for income inequality is ambiguous in the literature, evidence is presented suggesting a unique capacity for the accumulation of assets to increase the likelihood of a future financial crisis episode. Testing long-run panel data with a reduced form, two-way fixed effects model, estimates suggest that increasing wealth inequality, in an economy with high levels of aggregate wealth as measured by the wealth-income ratio, has a significantly positive and increasing marginal effect on the likelihood of future financial crises, particularly stock market crashes. Predicted probabilities from country-specific fixed effect logit models closely track the incidence of financial crises in the United States and United Kingdom over the last century. It is argued that these results reveal an important role for the distribution of accumulated assets in the macro-financial stability of rich countries. The distribution of stocks may capture structural vulnerabilities that the distribution of flows cannot expose, and hence more unequal countries in wealth face greater financial instability. An economic network hypothesis, elaborated in Chapter 2, is proposed for interpreting these results.   Chapter 2: Network Defect: Wealth Inequality, Network Topology, and Financial Crisis If two, otherwise identical, economies were distinguished only by their distributions of wealth, are they equally stable in response to a random shock? This essay proposes a theoretical financial network model to understand the relationship between wealth inequality and financial crises. In a financial network, financial assets link individual asset and liability holders to form a web of economic connections. The total connectivity of an individual is described by their degree, and the overall distribution of connections in the network is imposed through a degree distribution—equivalent to the wealth distribution as incoming connections represent assets and outgoing connections liabilities. A network's topology varies with the level of wealth inequality and total wealth and together, simulations show, they determine network contagion in the event of a random negative income shock to some individual. Random network simulations, whereby each financial connection is randomly placed, reveal that increasing wealth inequality makes a wealthy network less stable—as measured by the share of individuals failing financially or the decline in financial asset values. These results introduce the idea for a unique topological role for accumulated assets and their distribution in macro-financial stability.   Chapter 3: Instability, Credit, and Inequality in the Twentieth Century The final essay studies the long-run relationship between financial instability, wealth inequality and aggregate wealth, and household debt. Specifically, it examines whether wealth inequality and aggregate wealth are contributing forces to the level of financial instability in the United States over the 20th century, or whether debt is a more crucial lever. A more traditional role for income inequality is also investigated and compared, in which its long-run increases may add to household debt and, from there, to a financial crisis. Applying a vector autoregression model, which assumes the endogeneity of the variables, and studying any cointegrating relations provides statistical validity to these relationships through rigorous specification and hypothesis testing. Results show that wealth inequality, acting in concert with the large accumulation of aggregate financial wealth, contributes significantly and positively to financial instability. A second long-run relationship is found between household debt and wealth inequality, whereby increases in financial instability are the main adjusting force back to stationary levels. Less robust evidence is found strongly linking household debt to financial instability, though income inequality does significantly contribute to debt long-term. Together, these results emphasize the important role for the distribution of accumulated wealth in the stability of the US economy.},

The CJT consists of three elements-economic crisis, ideational change, and the nature of the policy change-that must be identified for us to be able to declare with some certainty if the changes to social partnership policy constituted a critical juncture. In this context, ideational change is very important, constituting the intermediating factor between a crisis and the subsequent nature of the policy change.

abstract = {This paper analyzes the relationship between inequality and the current account, addressing the role of the functional distribution of income. Using panel data for 60 countries over the period 1975-2011, our results confirm that an increase in the wage share is associated with a decrease in the current account. We also analyze the effects of wage share on saving and investment, maintaining the same control variables. We find that the wage share is negatively correlated with saving and does not have a significant effect on investment. This result is consistent with the theories that connect higher wages with greater consumption and less saving. The relationship is stronger for developing economies, highlighting the structural differences between different groups of countries. Specifically, the relevance and sign of control variables like financial intermediation, fiscal balance, demographic ratios, capital account openness and growth expectations show important differences according to the level of development.},

The works of Mckinnon, Shaw and the Neo-Structuralists were reviewed in great depth. Following the postulations of the Mckinnon - Shaw school and the Neo-Structuralists models, the role of interest rate in particular' in financial deepening and capital development became the centre piece of the study. In addition to that, is the demand for money, the effects of financial liberalisation and short run growth. Attempts were made to provide a contrast on the arguments advocated by the Mckinnon - Shaw school with those of Taylor et al ie the Neo-Structuralists. In support of the hypothesis that financial sector of an economy is important in its economic development, especially in a repressed economy, a thorough review of the Nigerian Financial System, Structure, Growth and Developments were provided in this thesis. The thesis also provides an indepth review of the Nigerian structural adjustment programme (SAP) and the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank. The objective of the dissertation, which provides the theme binding the chapters together, is a critical analysis of the operation of the structural adjustment programme for the financial sector, in the light of the theories of financial reform. The grouping into chapters provided a detailed overview of the main schools in financial development theory and the Nigerian economy. The thesis also relates to the dynamics of the demand and supply sides of the economy, the issues of foreign investment and policies and financial intermediation.},

several fiscal policies in monetary union. Five variants are analyzed:
restrictive fiscal policy in the south, fiscal expansion in the south,
fiscal expansion in the north, fiscal expansion in the whole area

illustrate the mechanisms at work in the crisis countries of Southern
Europe. The establishment of a restrictive fiscal policy in South
reduces public debt and the level of interest rates but at the cost of
slower growth. The effect of a policy of increasing demand in the south
is effective on growth but interest rates greatly increase. To avoid the
explosion rates in southern countries without jeopardizing growth, only
a political stimulus north can both boost production and reduce
imbalances within the euro area. Finally, a recovery policy in the whole
area is effective growth while limiting the increase in interest rates

Financial intermediaries in need of inquidity did everything in their power so that the securitization of assets could have a life of its own in financial operations. This is a process that is endogenous to the development of financialization.

Minsky recognized that money represents an IOU or promise to pay and that "acceptability" is its important feature. He further recognized that the State can play an important role in determining whose IOUs will be accepted (both publicly and privately). I will argue that support for the Chartalist vision of money as a 'creature of the State' can be found in Minsky. Finally, I will apply the Chartalist theory to Minsky's notion of a 'hierarchy of money' in order to suggest that the State determines not only the unit in which all of the monies in the hierarchy are denominated but also influences the positioning of certain monies within the hierarchy.},

To understand this infrastructure, it is crucial to know that the Diners' Club card was not, as it is sometimes described, the first credit card. Although the terms were sometimes used interchangeably, the Diners' Club card was not a credit card but a charge card. Payment is always already a vector of identity. It is a tool used to perform and determine identity. Paying with the Diners' Club card was an overt performance of identity as much as an economic transaction. In contrast to earlier department store lines of credit, the Diners' Club charge card overtly sought to serve as a form of a payment for the modern man.},

@article{Pathirane1982,
abstract = {The public sector is defined here to include government plus public enterprises. Historically, economists and statisticians have been more concerned with its separate components than with the public sector as a whole, but it is suggested that the public sector may be an appropriate concept for studying several current problems of economic policy. While there is general agreement as to what constitutes government, countries have differing views about what makes an enterprise public. Differences in country definitions of public enterprises are identified as one of the main problems in making international comparisons for the public sector. Statistics are presented for up to 16 OECD countries on the share of the public sector in total final demand, value added, employment, and net lending. It is argued that there is rarely a unique answer to the question “How big is the public sector?” For most countries judicious selection of data and careful definition will lead to different conclusions about the size and growth of the public sector. Because of the lack of data, it is not possible to analyse public sectors in developing countries in the same detail as OECD countries. The evidence available suggests that while public sectors are about the same size in both OECD and developing countries, public enterprises play a more important role in the latter.

abstract = {We investigate the impact of fiscal stimuli at different levels of the government debt-to-GDP ratio for a sample of 17 European countries from 1970 to 2010. This is implemented in an interacted panel VAR framework in which all coefficient parameters are allowed to change continuously with the debt-to-GDP ratio. We find that responses to government spending shocks exhibit strong nonlinear behavior. While the overall cumulative effect of a spending shock on real GDP is positive and significant at moderate debt-to-GDP ratios, this effect turns negative as the ratio increases. The total cumulative effect on the trade balance as a share of GDP is negative at first but switches sign at higher levels of debt. Consequently, depending on the degree of public indebtedness, our results accommodate long-run fiscal multipliers that are greater and smaller than one or even negative as well as twin deficit and twin divergence behavior within one sample and time period. From a policy perspective, these results lend additional support to increased prudence at high public debt ratios because the effectiveness of fiscal stimuli to boost economic activity or resolve external imbalances may not be guaranteed.},

abstract = {This article criticizes the view that the financial sector crisis of 2008 was the primary cause of the real sector crisis. It argues that the real sector economic crisis in the US can be understood as a crisis of over-investment. The over-investment crisis tendency is explained and a method of empirically identifying an over-investment crisis is proposed. The article analyzes the decline in the rate of profit in the US prior to the crisis, from 2004 to 2007, and the movements of the determinants of the rate of profit during that period, to show which underlying factors led to the profit rate decline. The article also examines the components of aggregate demand for the period 2001-10. The results of the analysis suggest that this crisis should be considered as a case of asset-bubble induced over-investment, which both depressed the rate of profit and eventually caused a sharp fall in aggregate demand.

abstract = {This study uses multivariate time series analysis to examine the linkages between federal budget deficits and merchandise trade deficits. Using a vectorautoregressive model, support is found for the notion that budget deficits influence trade deficits indirectly rather than directly. Evidence is obtained through causality testing and impulse response functions that the "twin deficits" are connected through the transmission mechanisms of interest rates and exchange rates. The model indicates that reducing the size of the budget deficit may prove to be at least as effective as exchange rate intervention for the purpose of reducing the size of the merchandise trade deficit. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {A study argues that macroeconomic evidence associates aging populations with lower savings rates, slower investment growth and a reduced rate of GDP growth.  These cross-country relationships can be vindicated by more robust regressions based on panel data.  Interpolations of the cross-country relationships to the year 2025 suggest some interesting changes in macroeconomic performance and in the relative ranking of OECD countries.  Some of the changes will have implications for individual behavior.  However, the evidence from individual data suggests that the life-cycle hypothesis of saving implicit in the cross-country predictions concerning the effect of aging populations on saving has weaknesses, particularly in explaining the saving behavior of the elderly, who do not dissave to the extent required by a stylized version of the theory.  A better understanding is needed of household savings behavior and,  in particular, of how intrafamilial and intergenerational transactions motivate behavior.},

@phdthesis{Barradas2015,
abstract = {This PhD thesis aims to assess the financialisation process in Portugal since the early 1980s and a particular dimension of the respective process in the European Union countries since the mid-1990s, through the compilation of four inter-related Essays. The broad and complex concept of financialisation tends to offer a negative perspective on the impact of growth of finance in the economy, contrary to the predictions of mainstream economics that considers the growth of finance as a general positive phenomenon. In that sense, the emergence of financialisation in Portugal is contextualised in an historical, economic and international perspective in the first Essay. Based on the analysis of several indicators, this Essay concludes that the Portuguese economy exhibits symptoms of financialisation that put in evidence its structural weaknesses and played an important role on the recent sovereign debt crisis. The second Essay aims to address empirically the relationship between financialisation and the Portuguese real investment through a time series econometric analysis. Financialisation, on the one hand, leads to a rise of financial investments by non-financial corporations, which deviates funds from real investments (“crowding out” effect). On the other hand, strong pressures around the intensification of financial payments restrain funds available for real investments. This Essay concludes that the financialisation process has hampered the Portuguese real investment, mainly through the channel linked with financial payments. The empirical analysis of the second Essay is extended to the European Union countries in the third Essay using a panel data econometric analysis. This Essay concludes that the financialisation process has also damaged real investment in European Union countries, mainly through the financial payments channel. The Essay is also able to identify that the financialisation process causes a higher slowdown in real investment in the more financialised countries, which represents an important conclusion for a less financialised economy like Portugal. The fourth Essay aims to assess empirically the relationship between financialisation and the Portuguese labour income share, conducting a time series econometric analysis. The financialisation process tends to increase the inequality on functional income distribution, visible in the growing importance of profit share in viidetriment of labour income share, which occurs through three channels: the change in the sectorial composition of the economy (due to the increase of the weight of financial activity and the decrease of government activity), the shareholder value philosophy and the weakening of trade unions. The Essay finds evidence that the financialisation process affected the evolution of the Portuguese labour income share, namely trough changes in government activity and in trade union density. Overall, this PhD thesis offers further evidence that the financialisation process also affects negatively and from different prisms the smaller, less developed and more peripheral economies, such as Portugal.   Alternate abstract: Esta tese de Doutoramento procura avaliar o processo de financeiriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o em Portugal desde os anos oitenta e uma dimens{\~{a}}o particular do mesmo processo nos pa{\'{i}}ses da Uni{\~{a}}o Europeia desde meados da d{\'{e}}cada de noventa, atrav{\'{e}}s da compila{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de quatro Ensaios inter-relacionados. O conceito amplo e complexo de financeiriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o tende a oferecer uma perspectiva negativa sobre o impacto do crescimento da finan{\c{c}}a na economia, ao contr{\'{a}}rio da teoria econ{\'{o}}mica convencional que considera o crescimento da finan{\c{c}}a como um fen{\'{o}}meno geralmente positivo. Neste sentido, a emerg{\^{e}}ncia da financeiriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o em Portugal {\'{e}} contextualizada segundo uma perspectiva hist{\'{o}}rica, econ{\'{o}}mica e internacional no primeiro Ensaio. Baseado na an{\'{a}}lise de v{\'{a}}rios indicadores, este Ensaio conclui que a economia portuguesa exibe sintomas de financeira{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o que colocaram em evid{\^{e}}ncia fraquezas estruturais desta economia, desempenhando portanto um papel importante na recente crise da d{\'{i}}vida soberana. O segundo Ensaio procura analisar empiricamente a rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o entre a financeiriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e o investimento real portugu{\^{e}}s atrav{\'{e}}s de uma an{\'{a}}lise econom{\'{e}}trica de s{\'{e}}ries temporais. A financeiriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, por um lado, conduz a um aumento dos investimentos financeiros por parte das empresas n{\~{a}}o financeiras, o que desvia fundos dos investimentos reais (efeito “crowding out”). Por outro lado, as press{\~{o}}es em torno da intensifica{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos pagamentos financeiros restringem igualmente os fundos dispon{\'{i}}veis para a materializa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de investimentos reais. Este Ensaio conclui que o processo de financeiriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o tem contribu{\'{i}}do para uma desacelera{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do investimento real portugu{\^{e}}s, principalmente atrav{\'{e}}s do canal dos pagamentos financeiros. A an{\'{a}}lise emp{\'{i}}rica do segundo Ensaio {\'{e}} estendida para os pa{\'{i}}ses da Uni{\~{a}}o Europeia no terceiro Ensaio usando uma an{\'{a}}lise econom{\'{e}}trica em dados de painel. Este Ensaio conclui que o processo de financeiriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o tem penalizado o investimento real nestes pa{\'{i}}ses, principalmente atrav{\'{e}}s dos pagamentos financeiros. Este Ensaio identifica ainda que o processo de financeiriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o causa um abrandamento mais acentuado do investimento real nos pa{\'{i}}ses mais financeirizados, o que acaba por se revelar uma conclus{\~{a}}o importante para uma economia menos financeirizada como a portuguesa. O quarto Ensaio procura avaliar empiricamente a rela{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o entre a financeiriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e a parcela dos rendimentos do trabalho em Portugal, conduzindo uma an{\'{a}}lise veconom{\'{e}}trica de s{\'{e}}ries temporais. O processo de financeiriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o tende a aumentar a desigualdade na distribui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o funcional do rendimento, vis{\'{i}}vel na crescente import{\^{a}}ncia dos lucros em detrimento da parcela dos rendimentos do trabalho, o que ocorre atrav{\'{e}}s de tr{\^{e}}s canais: a mudan{\c{c}}a na composi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o sectorial da economia (aumento do peso do sector financeiro e diminui{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do peso do sector p{\'{u}}blico), a filosofia subjacente {\`{a}} cria{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de valor para o acionista e o enfraquecimento dos sindicatos. O Ensaio conclui que o processo de financeiriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o tem sido respons{\'{a}}vel pela evolu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da parcela dos rendimentos do trabalho, sobretudo por via do peso do sector p{\'{u}}blico e dos sindicatos. De forma geral, esta tese de Doutoramento oferece evid{\^{e}}ncia adicional que o processo de financeiriza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o tamb{\'{e}}m afecta negativamente e sobre diferentes primas economias mais pequenas, menos desenvolvidas e mais perif{\'{e}}ricas, como Portugal.},

Such a rationalization would bring a lack of reflection on what should he the ultimate significance of certain technical means, which are confused with a value-in-itself of a social context. The paper highlight the fact that the function of credit consistent with individuals' 'ultimate ends' seems to he that of a temporal coordination between the 'bargaining wills' of different individuals who aim at obtaining the highest benefit hy means of the utility of their products and the products of their peers. But the current epoch has favored the elevation of historically determined features of credit-issuing to ultimate ends. Referring, among other sources, to a report hy the Bank of England and to studies hy Neo-Keynesian authors such as Stiglitz, this essay estahlishes that the consequence of the current private structure of credit-issuing is that the ultimate end of credit does not coincide with maximization and economic reciprocity hut with the assessment of a risk which is distinctly private. Also, since in this structure Central Bank acts as the hank of all commercial hanks, credit granting can he read as heing in function of the availability - within a circumscribed economic web - of a specific credit 'raw material' which has a price: central bank's liquidity. This situation puts a deep philosophical prohlem into the limelight, since any 'existential' preferability of the current model of credit issuing can only be explained as an alienation.},

@article{OECD2016,
abstract = {In recent years, there has been a revival of concerns that automation and digitalisation might after all result in a jobless future. The debate has been fuelled by studies for the US and Europe arguing that a substantial share of jobs is at "risk of computerisation". These studies follow an occupation-based approach proposed by Frey and Osborne (2013), i.e. they assume that whole occupations rather than single job-tasks are automated by technology. As we argue, this might lead to an overestimation of job automatibility, as occupations labelled as high-risk occupations often still contain a substantial share of tasks that are hard to automate. Our paper serves two purposes. Firstly, we estimate the job automatibility of jobs for 21 OECD countries based on a task-based approach. In contrast to other studies, we take into account the heterogeneity of workers{\&}{\#}8217; tasks within occupations. Overall, we find that, on average across the 21 OECD countries, 9 {\%} of jobs are automatable. The threat from technological advances thus seems much less pronounced compared to the occupation-based approach. We further find heterogeneities across OECD countries. For instance, while the share of automatable jobs is 6 {\%} in Korea, the corresponding share is 12 {\%} in Austria. Differences between countries may reflect general differences in workplace organisation, differences in previous investments into automation technologies as well as differences in the education of workers across countries.},

abstract = {This paper explores the hypothesis (most notably made by French
economist Thomas Piketty) that slow growth rates lead to rising
inequality. If true, this hypothesis would pose serious challenges to
achieving `prosperity without growth' or meeting the ambitions of those
who call for an intentional slowing down of growth on ecological
grounds. It would also create problems of social justice in the context
of a `secular stagnation'. The paper describes a closed, demand-driven,
stock-flow consistent model of Savings, Inequality and Growth in a
Macroeconomic framework (SIGMA) with exogenous growth and savings rates.
SIGMA is used to examine the evolution of inequality in the context of
declining economic growth. Contrary to the general hypothesis, we find
that inequality does not necessarily increase as growth slows down. In
fact, there are certain conditions under which inequality can be reduced
significantly, or even eliminated entirely, as growth declines. The
paper discusses the implications of this finding for questions of
employment, government fiscal policy and the politics of de-growth. (C)

abstract = {This paper traces the rise and fall of current account deficits in certain euro area countries and in the Baltics. These countries all entered the global financial crisis with sizable current account deficits, and the unwinding of these deficits has been a complex and painful process for most. While much of the general policy discussion of the large pre-crisis deficits has focused on losing export competitiveness, this paper highlights other results in the literature regarding import booms as well as a dimension that is rarely discussed - the drop in the non-trade portion of the current account (transfers and net income balance) in many countries. The paper also examines progress made in unwinding these deficits. Most countries have made tangible progress, but with different degrees: improvement of price competitiveness and a shift of production from non-tradable to tradable sectors has helped increase exports and along with compressed imports, close the current account deficits. The adjustment, though, has taken place against recessions and low growth in the euro area, and the paper also considers what has made the process more painful in some countries rather than others. We find that large current account balances prior to the crisis is the best predictor of a sharp drop in output during the crisis. Supportive macro policies to cushion the adjustment process and keep overall euro inflation at or above target level are necessary. In the longer term, improving institutions to deal with imbalances (and preventing them at future entry) are important. {\textcopyright} CEPR, CESifo, Sciences Po, 2016.},

abstract = {A balanced current account in the euro area has disguised sizable imbalances at the country level, exposing the common currency area to severe pressures during the financial crisis. The key contribution of this paper is to evaluate the adjustment process using the New Multi Country Model (NMCM) at the country and sectoral levels. The model suggests that a recovery in wage competitiveness reduces external deficits but has only mildly expansionary effects at the cost of higher net borrowing by households. It also suggests that the impact of an aggregate demand shock in Germany is not enough to lead to a rebound in economic activity and address external imbalances in the rest of the euro area. Finally, the presence of supportive external conditions, while facilitating the implementation of vital reforms, would not necessarily unravel intra-euro-area imbalances. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

@article{Houben2011,
abstract = {Two main theories exist about crisis: the Keynesian and the Marxist one. In this article, we try to analyze what can be the pertinence of the Keynesian analysis in a Marxist perspective. Keynes was in favor of regulated capitalism, not for a change of society. His main task as he defines it for himself was to find everything which can save the capitalist system. But his vision is fundamentally a short term one. Then he proposes a revival of investments, if not by private businessmen, by the State. But the effects, because he neglects the long term, are no new and durable growth and the development of public debt. It's why Keynes's theory cannot really solve crisis. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Sovereign ratings are designed to mitigate investors' risk exposure by highlighting the fiscal condition of governments. The problem is that sovereign ratings entail reciprocal oversight of rating agencies and sovereign governments -- which raises conflicts of interest and, ironically, creates incentives for distorted risk assessments. Private rating agencies hold sovereign governments accountable by assessing their risk exposure, while sovereign governments hold rating agencies accountable through regulation. During booms, governments and rating agencies have convergent interests in understating risks until market bubbles are on the cusp of bursting because bubbles produce higher tax revenue and profits. This Article advocates an intermediation strategy of integrating a broader array of ratings stakeholders into a stakeholder regulatory organization to oversee the industry.},

@phdthesis{LaDue2018,
abstract = {This dissertation is an ethnography of the nonprofit institution, the Center for Community Self-Help, and the development media in Durham, North Carolina that together work to support rent-intensifying pro-growth development in the city. Self-Help discursively, financially, and geographically manages rent-intensifying development in Durham by partnering with the city and other institutions, principally Duke University, to manage community relations, shepherd state and federal tax credits and other public financing, and act as a symbol of progressive politics. Through innovative methods developed over a five-year media and institutional ethnography of Self-Help in Durham, this case study examines development media: the discourses, institutions, actors, and publications that work to support pro-growth development in the city by various means, including critiquing the very development that they support. This case study seeks to answer how it is that as critiques of gentrification propagate and the institution Self-Help grows – backed by progressives and other nonprofits in the city and identified as a developer seeking to close the wealth gap – inequality in the city also continues to grow. The findings show that despite Self-Help's claims to supporting community, promoting affordable housing, bringing in jobs, honoring a black working class history, supporting a better future for all, and cooperating and partnering with other institutions, their real estate development work leads to further inequality and dispossession of the poor, majority African-American and Latino populations in the city. Moreover, the discourses used to justify their developments actually act as a mechanism to allow this development to take place more efficiently by rationalizing the use of public funding for projects that support private wealth. This study concludes that urban development as we know it, even when taken on by institutions claiming to address inequality, rely on speculative development models that use our public resources to grow wealth for those who already have it.},

We interpret 'global banking' as 'global central banking', focus on the role of international monetary policies and global liquidity for financial stability and identify imponderables emerging in this context. Central banks continue to stress that they will keep interest rates low for a prolonged period, in spite of negative side effects such as deferred bank balance sheet repair. We show that it is crucial to cope with these challenges to return to and ensure global financial stability in the future. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The literature distinguishes three competing models of the money supply process, namely, 'pure portfolio approach', 'pure loan demand approach' and 'mixed portfolio-loan demand approach'. While the first corresponds to the money multiplier approach, the latter two are the accommodative and structuralist views of money endogenenity of the post-Keynesian monetary theory. Using RBI monthly data, this study finds the endogenous nature of money supply in India where a paradigm of mixed portfolio loan model operates. It supports the structural approach implying that the policy stance of the monetary authority and private initiatives of banks are important in money supply determination.]},

This hypothesis may be interpreted as a generalization to the short and the long run of the theories that put no weight on the real effects of public policies on aggregate demand.

The theoretical literature emphasizes several reasons for departures from this hypothesis. However, the empirical literature is inconclusive. When Ricardian equivalence is tested in a life–cycle framework the hypothesis is usually rejected, while when the empirical analysis is based on optimizing models, it is usually accepted.},

@techreport{danske2017danish,
abstract = {This document provides an overview of the Danish covered bond market and its pass-through bonds, including details of the securities underlying the bonds. Until 2007, issuance of Danish covered bonds (mortgage bonds) in Denmark was through specialist mortgage banks, of which the general feature was a pass-through product. However, a significant revision of the law in 2007 paved the way for non-specialist banks to issue covered bonds. Covered bonds issued out of Denmark fall into two categories: traditional Danish mortgage bonds (the pure pass-through product) and euro-style covered bonds in a jumbo format (similar to what exists in euroland). The pass-through products are tapped on a daily basis in the domestic market and comprise one of the largest residential covered bond markets in Europe. Currently, only Danske Bank has established a euro medium-term note (EMTN) covered bond programme and issues euro-style covered bonds similar to those in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, etc. Chapter 1 briefly outlines why Danish covered bonds are an interesting asset class. Chapter 2 explains the legal framework of the Danish mortgage credit system and the security aspects of Danish covered bonds. Chapter 3 describes the Danish mortgage banks and Chapter 4 provides an overview of the current ratings of each institution and their rated capital centres. Chapter 5 gives a detailed description of the characteristics of Danish covered bonds and Chapter 6 describes the primary and secondary markets. Moving on to prepayments, Chapter 7 explains how covered bonds can be refinanced and shows different types of remortgaging strategies. Chapter 8 explains how to estimate prepayment rates for callable covered bonds. Chapter 9 gives an overview of investor distribution. Chapter 10 presents different ways of measuring the yield pickup of Danish covered bonds and introduces option-adjusted figures for yield spreads (OAS) and durations. In Chapter 11, we describe bond futures on Danish covered bonds. Finally, Chapter 12 summarises the available data on Danish covered bonds. For more information on the euro-style Danish covered bond, see the Danske Bank publication Nordic Covered Bond Handbook: The handbook of the Nordic covered bond markets and issuers, 1 September 2017.},

How did formal institutional support abroad for targeting low inflation follow from an international acceptance of these ideas? And how did a consensus theoretical model develop in academia? The article tells how the modern theoretical consensus known as the New Neoclassical Synthesis (aka, the New Keynesian model) reinforces key advances: the priority for price stability, the targeting of core rather than headline inflation, the importance of credibility for low inflation, and preemptive interest rate policy supported by transparent objectives and procedures. The conclusion identifies important practical issues that remain to be explored in theory.},

abstract = {This paper presents a Keynesian model which describes three countries trading merchandise and financial assets with one another. It is initially assumed that all three countries have independent fiscal policies but that two of the countries share a currency, hence the model can be used to make a preliminary analysis of the conduct of economic policy in 'the eurozone' vis-{\`{a}}-vis the rest of the world - 'the USA'. The main conclusion will be that, if all three countries do indeed operate independent fiscal policies, the system will work under a floating currency regime, but only so long as the European central bank is prepared to modify the structure of its assets by accumulating an ever rising proportion of bills issued by any 'weak' euro country. {\textcopyright} 2007 Oxford University Press.},

abstract = {This paper combines a classical approach to economics with standard finance theory in a Lotka-Volterra framework. The models are agent-based, general Lotka-Volterra (GLV) models, using very simple homogeneous or heterogeneous agents. The agents are owners of capital, they receive wages and returns on their capital, and spend a portion of their wealth on consumption. As such the models use realistic economic variables. The models give simple outputs of ‘log-normal'-like bodies and power tail distributions for both wealth and income. These distributions match those seen in real economies. The models are unique in giving real world distributions from a statistical mechanical model that uses absolutely identical agents. The models demonstrate that wealth and income inequality is driven by the economic force of concentration of capital through a statistical-mechanical wealth condensation process. The models also show a direct relationship between the macroeconomic labour share of income and the distributions of personal wealth and income. In addition, the models give a proposed ‘compulsory saving' regime that appears highly effective for the reduction of poverty. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Nykredit Markets has a continued focus on the Nordic region as our core market, and we are pleased to introduce our Covered Bond handbook for Denmark. With around EUR-equivalent 367bn (DKK 2,733bn) of covered bonds outstanding, the Danish market is the largest in the Nordic region. In August 2017, Denmark gained the spot of being the largest covered bond market in the world. The gained top spot cannot be ascribed to new issuance, as the outstanding amount of Danish covered bonds has only grown marginally by 2{\%} from 2015 to 2016, but rather a significant reduction in the outstanding amounts of covered bonds in Germany and Spain, the two former leading covered bond issuer nations. Despite Denmark not being a Eurozone country, 3{\%} of outstanding covered bonds are EUR-denominated and 96{\%} DKK-denominated. The Danish covered bond market is a very transparent market with a 210-year impeccable track record. All major issuers have AAA rated covered bonds which makes Danish covered bonds more attractive ina shrinking AAA universe. The handbook includes an overview of macro-economic fundamentals and housing market trends in Denmark, as well as a description of Denmark's covered bond market and relevant legislation. Following on from this are individual profiles on all major Danish covered bond issuers. The issuer profiles address the key factors necessary to evaluate an issuer's covered bonds, namely the issuer (or parent) itself, the underlying cover pool(s), ALM and rating. Should you have any questions regarding the handbook, or covered bonds in general, please do not hesitate to contact us. The handbook is also available for registered users online at nykredit.com.

abstract = {Financialization describes a phenomenon whereby financial markets assume an increasingly dominant role within the economy. This paper seeks to dissect the role of information and communications technology (ICT) in financialization by following a cross-disciplinary approach across finance, economics and information systems. Accordingly, we develop a general framework describing the relationship between ICT and financialization. This framework allows us to investigate the recent rise of online marketplaces for credit. Consequently, ICT is not only facilitating, but fundamentally driving a disintermediation of banks through advances in computing, communication and information technology. We also provide supporting evidence from interviews with almost 40 senior experts and C-level executives. Interestingly, only rather recent innovations have enabled the popularity of marketplace lending, such as cloud computing, big data, scalable IT infrastructures and comprehensive ecosystems of programming interfaces. In contrast, we observe a slow integration of advanced analytics in the field of risk management. Based on our analysis, the paper also discusses cross-country implications for marketplace lending, financialization and regulation.},

abstract = {The world economy is still suffering from its most severe crisis since the Great Depression of the late 1920s to the early 1930s. On the one hand, the present mess is caused by a financial crisis which started with the collapse of the subprime mortgage market in the US in summer 2007, then exacerbated with the breakdown of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc in September 2008 and finally reached another peak with the euro crisis in early to mid-2010. Under the conditions of deregulated and liberalized international financial markets, the financial crisis rapidly spread all over the world. On the other hand, people are witnessing a far more fundamental disruption which started with an economic downswing in the US well before the financial crisis. This paper focuses on the changes in distribution triggered by "finance-dominated capitalism" embedded in the "neo-liberal" policy stance in effect since the early 1980s, on the global and regional imbalances underlying the present financial and economic crisis, and on the economic policy requirement emanating from the analysis of the deeper causes of the crisis.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study Ramsey-optimal fiscal and monetary policy in a medium-scale model of the U.S. business cycle. The model features a rich array of real and nominal rigidities that have been identified in the recent empirical literature as salient in explaining observed aggregate fluctuations. The main result of the paper is that price stability appears to be a central goal of optimal monetary policy. The optimal rate of inflation under an income-tax regime is 1/2 percent per year, with a volatility of 1.1 percent. This result is surprising given that the model features a number of frictions - particularly nonstate-contingent nominal public debt, no lump-sum taxes, and sticky wages - that, in isolation, would call for a volatile rate of inflation. Under an income-tax regime, the optimal income-tax rate is quite stable, with a mean of 30 percent and a standard deviation of 1.1 percent. Simple monetary and fiscal rules are shown to implement a competitive equilibrium that mimics well the one induced by the Ramsey policy. When the fiscal authority is allowed to tax capital and labor income at different rates, optimal fiscal policy is characterized by a large and volatile subsidy on capital.},

abstract = {Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have accumulated large foreign net liabilities, exposing them to increased financial market pressure during the current crisis period. This analysis decomposes cumulated lending and borrowing over the past decade into sector-level contributions and compares them with the euro area average. It shows strong borrowing by households and non-financial corporations with government further increasing net borrowing in Greece and Portugal. Financial corporations act in this context as intermediaries between foreign savings and domestic borrowers. The sector-level contributions to an economy's foreign net liabilities vary significantly by country, which implies a need for different adjustment paths. In a currency union, given the absence of a mechanism for transfer payments between member states, there is a heightened risk that large foreign liabilities will become unsustainable. Thus, member states must contain external imbalances, which often reflect a loss of competitiveness and internal imbalances, to prevent the reoccurrence of current vulnerabilities. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

On the one hand, some companies are pursuing active involvement of employees in these programs, and on the other hand, in some cases, CSR programs targeting even company employees - an important class of stakeholders. The relation between CSR and HRM started to be increasingly researched in the near past. As the CSR practices became more and more important to each company's stakeholders, the HR professionals play a key role in identifying the right employees to help increase the CSR performance. CSR may be used as a tool for HR practitioners to promote the achievement of the businesses sustainability and therefore developing the social and environmental conditions. Global companies became more and more interested in CSR as the sustainable development is taking place of the old ways of doing business. The core of CSR tackles problems like human rights, labour and employment practices, health care and environment. HR is in the middle of this system directing and educating the company regarding the CSR. This article focuses on the relation of CSR and HRM in financial sector, where the employees are the main asset of the company. If the CSR efforts are not supported by the HR engagement, all becomes a PR exercise.},

We observe a systematic coordination between firms of each sector, and
between each sector. The resulting pattern of relative prices is fairly
consistent with the labor theory of value. These emerging features are

abstract = {Ever since the latest financial crisis broke out, we have been witnessing an unexpected revival of Marxist theories as part of the effort to better understand the phenomena behind the current crisis. Marxist analysis can achieve an appropriate hegemonic role in the public debate on the basis that distinctive Marxist approaches provide a superior explanation for the current crisis. A "Marxist perspective on periodic crises" can be based on the idea that periodic crises are not to be considered as a pathology of the market system, but as a natural outcome of the way it works. This understanding of crises as a structural element in capitalist growth has the power to increase our knowledge of reality. Moreover, the core Marxist insight -- crisis as a necessary restorative aspect of capitalist accumulation rather than as an arbitrary disruption -- is necessary to the project of synthesizing the various elements in the crisis literature: real vs. financial, general vs. contingent, periodic/cyclical vs. long-term/systemic.},

We find that, after a “supersanction” was imposed, a country improved its fiscal discipline. As a result, ex ante default probabilities on new issues fell dramatically and the country spent no additional time in default.

First, we will examine briefly the theory of profits in the history of economic thought, seeing that despite the importance of profits for a capitalist system, economists have tended to ignore them, not offering any explanation about their determination and generation. Then, we will look at the evolution of profits in the Spanish economy in the period 2000-2011. Doing this, we will take advantage of the method first devised by Jerome Levy and Michal Kalecki in the 1910's and 1930's, respectively. We will see that, contrary to the general belief among economists and businessmen, profits LK have soared since the beginning of the crisis in 2007, due mainly to the huge government deficits and the improvement in the foreign sector. Finally, we will compare our measure of profits against other common measures, such as the Madrid Stock Exchange volume of profits or the Bank of Spain's Central Balance Sheet Data Office, focusing on the impact of capital gains on the business sector and concluding that the prospects for profits in the following years are quite gloomy.

The model incorporates an active banking sector and pays particular attention to the leverage of both firms and banks. It is shown that the endogenous change in the desired margins of safety of firms and banks is likely to transform an otherwise stable debt-burdened economy into an unstable one. The endogeneity of the desired margins of safety can also produce, under certain conditions, investment and leverage cycles during which investment and leverage move both in the same and in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the paper investigates the potential stabilising role of fiscal policy. It is indicated that fiscal policy can reduce the destabilising forces in the macroeconomy when government expenditures adjust adequately to variations in the divergence between the actual and the desired margins of safety. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Some fundamental issues of fiscal and monetary policy are discussed within a stock-flow-consistent macroeconomic framework for an open economy. The core of the model is the financial sector with both a capital market and a money market and correspondingly differing interest rates. Further key elements are households which maximize an inter-temporal utility function with respect to both consumption and wealth, profit maximizing firms subject to a production function with decreasing returns to scale, and government expenses funded by both taxes and public debt. Concerning monetary policy, different regimes are discussed, including monetary abstinence, quantitative easing, and monetizing public debt. Typical Keynesian policy measures such as rising wages, expansionary monetary policy, and public deficit spending are also discussed. The main focus is on long term effects of these measures, with the dynamics being only briefly sketched. Because the model is entirely solvable analytically, it may also be useful as a means of didactics.

abstract = {Purpose – The discourse on credit cycles has been reinvigorated following the global crisis. The purpose of this paper is to contrast the positions of mainstream, Marxist, Austrian and post-Keynesian (PK) schools of thought on these matters. It is posited that most notions underplay the significance of real economy factors in shaping the fluctuations of credit levels and relations. It is argued these ideas are best illustrated by Marx (as interpreted by the Temporal Single System Interpretation) and tendency for the profit rate to fall with accumulation. Empirical evidence on the UK profit rate is provided as supporting evidence. Design/methodology/approach – The paper explores the theoretical work on credit and business cycles from the relevant schools of thought and contrasts them. The aim is to consider which approach best describes the reality. Empirical work on the profit rate provides supporting evidence. Findings – It is argued that the mainstream view of monetary neutrality is an insufficient explanation of the financial reality associated with credit and business cycles. Instead, it is posited that the PK approach, which emphasizes productive and financial factors, is more preferable. This contrasts with the usual singular financialization commentary that is used to describe the financial crisis and real economy stagnation that followed. It is argued that Marx's notion of falling profit and its ramifications best explain the reality of both the credit and business cycle. This is supported by the evidence. Research limitations/implications – It is problematic to calculate a Marxian rate of profit given the lack of suitable reported statistics. The research illustrates the significance of productive factors, especially the tendency for the profit rate to fall, in driving business cycles. There are, therefore, implications for government fiscal/monetary/industrial policies to reflect these factors when seeking to influence the business cycle. Practical implications – Policies that are designed to target levels of profitability are likely to be beneficial for capitalist sustainability. Social implications – The focus on profitability in the paper informs individuals working in business organizations of some of the imperatives facing corporations in a modern competitive environment. Originality/value – Whether financial factors drive the business cycle, or are themselves driven by it, is an important question given that policy prescriptions will differ depending on the answer. The recent financialization commentary, for instance, suggests that better regulation or reform of the financial sector will preclude unstable business cycles. The paper argues, in contrast, that the cause of the credit instability is rooted in production (following Marx) and that, therefore, a more production-focused policy response is required whilst recognizing the instabilities of the credit system. This latter point has a measure of originality in the current discourse.},

abstract = {Policymakers across the globe responded differently to the Great Recession, some with harsh austerity, others with activist income support and job growth strategies. This diversity offers a good laboratory to assess the relative merits of stimulus and austerity responses. Much of the answer depends on the values of "the multiplier" -- the ratio of change in GDP to the resources expended due to the policy. Ever since Keynes made the multiplier a cornerstone of the analysis laid out in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, it has been standard shorthand for discussing the impact of exogenous "shocks" of various kinds to the macroeconomy. In light of this, it is little wonder that recent multiplier-based assessments of the wisdom of fiscal stimulus have been all over the map-ranging from the highly pessimistic to the highly optimistic. Each of these individual assessments was calculated on a particular set of assumptions, using a particular methodology, at various levels of aggregation, examining a particular time frame.},

abstract = {A compact, one-sector version of recent large-scale income distribution models is presented. Different specifications of endogenous and exogenous variables in the model (or assumptions about how it is closed) change its qualitative behavior directly. A 'Keynesian' closure in which investment is exogenous and nominal changes in prime cost are passed along into price increases demonstrates relative insensitivity of the functional income distribution to factor prices. An alternative 'neoclassical' closure in which investment is endogenous (determined by savings) and output prices are fixed is much more responsive. The large-scale models are closed on Keynesian lines, and also have relatively insensitive functional distributions. If these models adequately describe real economies, causes besides general equilibrium price response must be invoked to explain distributional change. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

We uncover a large impact of declines in export competitiveness and asymmetric trade developments vis-{\`{a}}-vis the rest of the world - in particular vis-{\`{a}}-vis China, Central and Eastern Europe, and oil exporters - on the external balance of euro area debtor countries. While current account imbalances of euro area deficit countries vis-{\`{a}}-vis the rest of the world increased, they were financed mostly by intra-euro area capital inflows (in particular by the purchase of government and financial institutions' securities, and cross-border interbank lending) which permitted external imbalances to grow over time. {\textcopyright} 2013 CEPR, CES, MSH.},

abstract = {This article proposes a collaboration between post-Keynesians and feminist economists with regard to macroeconomic policies aimed at the socialization of investment, in particular the proposal for the government to act at once as the Employer of Last Resort and as a social provider. This is particularly important in the UK because the coalition government's Spending Review and Plan for Growth have dismantled public services and welfare benefits while emphasizing a narrow range of productive activities. This strategy threatens to widen the inequality that has led to low levels of demand and reliance by low- and middle-income households on unsustainable borrowing in order to maintain living standards. The article therefore contributes to current debates about alternative macroeconomic policies: it argues that the current emphasis on austerity needs to be replaced by a social provisioning approach that requires us to first pose the question of what the economy should be for.

We focus on the United Kingdom, under a range of institutional arrangements. Rather than operating solely by means of "the" exogenous interest rate, we consider the real process by which the central bank exerts its influence on the banking system, and how that is transmitted to the credit market and the money market. The focus is on process rather than equilibrium, and on the state of expectations, departing from the usual dualism between the interest rate and the money supply.},

We adopt a stock–flow consistent (SFC) approach with an emphasis on the dynamics of the labour market. We numerically solve the model using a combination of estimation and calibration to generate statistics for our key variables, reflecting features of the Danish economy. We then analyse the effects of a fall in the unemployment compensation rate on the economy. The results indicate that a fall in the compensation rate at a macro level leads to a trade-off between a fall in aggregate demand and a rise in net exports. Due to this trade-off, the net effect of a fall in the compensation rate on the aggregate unemployment rate tends to be weak. Our analyses in this paper raise several questions on the existing views regarding unemployment benefits adopted by a large strand of the economic literature. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Author.},

Further, we provide an update on recent changes to the covered bond landscape within each jurisdiction, as well as descriptions of the legislative frameworks that apply in each of the four markets. The publication also includes updates on housing market developments and the macroeconomic backdrop. Most covered bond issuers are subsidiaries of larger, universal banks. The specialist banking principle is applied in Norway and partly in Denmark, while Sweden and Finland do not adhere to this principle. Within each jurisdiction, we generally focus on the largest issuers, giving preference to names that are also active issuers in euro. However, the list of issuers included in the handbook is not exhaustive and particularly in Norway there are many smaller issuers that focus on covered bond funding in local currency, which are not included in the handbook.},

Financialization refers to both the rising political and economic power of financial service firms and the growing importance of financial, rather than production, strategies in the rest of the economy. In the US case at least, financialization also accompanied a shift from values associated with employment and production to a normative elevation of financial investment. In the US the financialization dimension of neoliberalism has increased national and global systemic risk, increased income inequality between sectors of the economy, capital and labor and among classes of workers, and at the same time has led to decreased employment and a less productive economy. The lesson is that, despite the surface attractiveness of globalized finance, financialization is a particular dangerous dimension of neoliberal politics and policy.},

Rising indebtedness increases the susceptibility of homeowners to housing and labor market restructuring, and if the degree of leverage is very high, can threaten the solvency, living standards, and social stability of local communities. However, very little is understood regarding how levels of household indebtedness are spatially distributed within or across cities, and how private debt maps onto the geography of race, class, housing, urban form, and other social variables, especially outside of the United States. It remains unknown whether and how higher and unsustainable levels of indebtedness might be associated with urban growth, decline, suburbanization, gentrification, immigration, racialization, and/or greying.

abstract = {What can money do? Can it be put to work to address deepening forms of social and economic inequality associated with the financial crisis, ongoing recession and still unfolding politics of austerity? Can we have faith in money as an injustice-remedying substance in a crisis-ridden and (still thoroughly) financialised reality? While the latter scenario is implied in recent feminist calls to redistribute resources to redress widening socio-economic inequalities under austerity, in this article I suggest that such a redistributive logic fails to account for the shifting capacities of resources, including the capacities of money. To track these shifting capacities, I revisit the demands of the 1970s women's liberation movement and especially the assumptions at play in these demands that money both measure and distribute justice. While these assumptions were arguably politically efficacious in that moment, in the contemporary present, pervasive financialisation has involved a material transformation to the capacities of money, a transformation that, I will suggest, leaves its justice-distributing potential in doubt. This article therefore not only calls for careful exploration of the capacities of resources in analyses of crisis, recession and austerity, but also for feminist theory to rethink redistributive justice in the light of such transformations. Central to these considerations is money in the wages form.},

abstract = {The main aim of this paper is to empirically test the endogenous money hypothesis for the Eurozone. Based on data on loans to private sector, deposits, monetary aggregates, prices and GDP we use three empirical approaches to test the hypothesis: (i) moving correlation; (ii) Granger causality tests and (iii) original framework for the analysis based on the structural VAR model. The empirical results confirm our main hypothesis on the endogeneity of money in the Eurozone as they show that the commonly accepted neoclassical relations between monetary variables, inflation and economic activity are reversed in case of Eurozone and that the direction of influence goes from loans to deposits and from real sector of the economy towards the monetary sector. The basic conclusion from carried out research is that ECB should implement measures directly aimed at stimulation of domestic demand (monetary-supported tax cut)./Temeljna svrha ovog rada je empirijski testirati hipotezu endogenosti novca u eurozoni. Na temelju podataka o kreditima privatnom sektoru, depozitima, monetarnim agregatima, cijenama i BDP-u autori u radu koriste tri empirijska pristupa za testiranje hipoteze: (i) pomicnu korelaciju; (ii) Grangerov test uzrocnosti i (iii) originalni metodoloski okvir temeljen na strukturnom VAR modelu. Empirijski rezultati potvrduju nasu temeljnu hipotezu o endogenosti novca u eurozoni buduci da pokazuju kako su opceprihvaceni neoklasicni odnosi izmedu monetarnih varijabli, inflacije i ekonomske aktivnosti u slucaju eurozone preokrenuti te kako se smjer utjecaja krece od kredita prema depozitima te od realnog sektora prema monetarnom sektoru. Temeljni zakljucak provedenog istrazivanja je da bi Europska sredisnja banka trebala implementirati mjere direktno usmjerene na poticanje agregatne potraznje (monetarno-financirano porezno rasterecenje).},

abstract = {Ukraine and Turkey, located on the south and north of the Black Sea, have so far not been able to develop a strategic economic partnership. Prior to 2002, the Turkish economy had been characterized by volatile growth rates, high inflation and a weak fiscal position. These, along with political instability (and coups), led to a number of financial and economic crises culminating in a major one in 2001. Following the latter, structural and macroeconomic reforms were implemented with persistence. Positive results were attained in a relatively short period of time. The reforms strengthened Turkey's economic resilience in the face of the global financial crises of 2007/8. This paper 1) analyzes the level of bilateral relations between Ukraine and Turkey, and it gives a comparative description of main macroeconomic indicators of these countries; 2) analyzes the principal factors influencing the development of the strategic partnership between countries Turkey and Ukraine in the economic sphere; 3) presents a selective background of the Turkish economy with a view to underline key macroeconomic weaknesses prior to 2001 crises; 4) reviews and assesses macroeconomic and structural reforms in Turkey after 2001 which made it among the least affected counties when the global crises hit the world economy; 5) presents key lessons learned from the Turkish experience which may prove valuable for policy design and implementation for Ukraine and other emerging economies.},

@phdthesis{Doyran2007,
abstract = {This comparative case study explores the relationship between hegemony and international financial stability. In particular, it examines how the U.S. exercises power through financial crisis management and whether hegemony is a necessary and sufficient precondition for stability. This study's purpose is to contribute to the debate surrounding the U.S.'s role in international financial system maintenance by comparing one Bretton Woods with two post-Bretton Woods crises. The study examines data in order to evaluate the four major theories of hegemony positing that the U.S. was responsible for the relatively smooth operation of the postwar financial order. When the 1950s and 1960s were idealized as the golden age of stability, events such as the financial crises of the 1970s and 1990s were then seen as a retreat from hegemonic responsibilities and surrender to multi-polar, unstable and crisis prone systems.    Are periods of hegemony more conducive to crisis prevention, financial openness and system maintenance? Is the conventional literature correct in characterizing the post-Bretton Woods system as one "crisis," "disorder" or "post-hegemonic"? Our findings affirm the main thesis of this study that there is no "sufficient" correlation between the concentration of financial power (hegemony) in the international system and the degree of stability (absence or presence of crises) in the system. The U.S. intervention in 1966 through the imposition of higher reserve requirements conflicted with the need to provide continued stability during a period of growing international liquidity. Against the assumption of international instability as a result of U.S. decline, the 1974 and 1998 crises further confirmed that post-Bretton Woods paradoxically reinforced the same goals as Bretton Woods: (1) promotion of free trade and open finance, (2) intervention in international financial crises to maintain a liberal international order.    There is a gap in the prevailing paradigms precisely because they can't anticipate the kinds of expressions of renewed power and contradictions of crisis management that are present in our three cases. Conventional literature makes broad statements yet cannot account for the specific instances of "contradictions" of state power. This is where this study can make its contribution to the debate on hegemony and global finance.},

abstract = {This article interprets the initial success of the launch of the euro and its ‘muddling through' since the outbreak of the Greek sovereign debt crisis. Two interrelated processes interacted to deliver a quite complex idiosyncratic systemic crisis. First, new classical macroeconomics had diffused the belief that market economies are structurally stable, money is neutral, financial markets are efficient and that the only culprit is public finance. The euro crisis was thus inaccurately diagnosed. Second, in the political arena, monetary integration has been used by many governments as a justification for liberalisation reforms opposed by various domestic social groups. At the European level, most governments have been defending national interests, whereas the European Commission and European Parliament had lost most of their expertise and legitimacy in defending a common community in line euro ambitions. Crisis resolution calls for leadership from a key collective actor, to return coherence to the eurozone's institutional setting. Key},

abstract = {In 1980, Jimmy Carter's Treasury Secretary, G. William Miller, greeted the pas-sage of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act with the promise that it would create a "new world" for US consumer finance. Much of the pro-deregulation rhetoric focused on removing or breaking down two kinds of "borders." The first border is structural, wherein operating procedures and regulations within the system regulate what different financial institutions can and cannot do. From the vantage point of the financial crisis that began in 2007, deregulation clearly produced lasting economic and cultural changes in the US. However, these changes have not been as unequivocally beneficial as supporters of deregulation had claimed or hoped. Furthermore, borders-physical and metaphorical-are still evident in the "new world" promised by the deregulation measures. The world crafted by financial deregulation since the 1980s has, unlike that of any other era in recent memory, aggressively annexed historically excluded groups into the imagined clientele of financial services.},

The purpose of this paper is to address issues of meaning that arise in this particular discourse, with a view to clarifying both conflicts in usage and the underlying issues involved. We explore the different meanings of openness and closure extant in the literature, as applied at the ontological and epistemological levels, focusing on our own use of the terms in relation to that which prevails in neoclassical economics on the one hand and to the use made of them by Tony Lawson and other critical realists on the other.

Three SFC models are considered, the first one with a fixed dollar-yuan parity including a version with Chinese foreign reserves' diversification, the second with a flexible dollar-yuan parity which can be freely floating or following a more managed float, the third one being a generalization of the two others with flexible prices instead of constant prices. The fixity of the dollar-yuan parity limits the adjustments facing shocks and world imbalances while a more flexible dollar-yuan exchange rate appears as a powerful adjustment mechanism to reduce these imbalances.

abstract = {1 " If we are wrong and high profit margins manage to endure for the next few years (particularly when global demand growth is below trend), there are broader questions to be asked about the efficacy of capitalism. " -Goldman Sachs investors' note, February 3, 2016, as quoted in Bloomberg News Executive Summary Academics and policymakers have recently focused on a worsening economic phenomenon commonly referred to as the decline in " business dynamism, " that is, the declining rate at which new businesses are formed and the rate at which they grow. This decline in dynamism and entrepreneurship accompanies a decline in overall labor market mobility, including quits and geographic migration for work, and has sparked a new literature on the subject by researchers including the Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors and numerous other academics, as well as extensive journalistic coverage. However, most of these analyses stress supply-side factors such as excessive occupational licensing and restrictions on building new housing. The data reject these supply-side interpretations, so this paper provides an alternative explanation for the recent trends of declining entrepreneurship, falling labor mobility, and rising concentration of employment in old firms and large firms. The erosion in labor mobility and entrepreneurship since 2000 can be more accurately explained by weak demand, especially during the slow recovery from the two previous recessions. These economic trends, in turn, should be investigated and understood through a lens of power shifting in favor of the owners and managers of incumbent firms alongside rising profits and inter-firm inequality.},

abstract = {The present article addresses the relationship between the process of economic integration of the European Union and the rise of financialization in the continental economy. For that purpose, it analyzes the policies applied and the main macroeconomic indicators of a selected group of countries. The conditions imposed by the Treaty of Maastricht and the Convergence Criteria show a strong neoliberal mark, in alignment with those of the Washington Consensus Agenda, promoting the development of the financial activities and favoring the interest of the financial actors to the detriment of other sectors, such as the industrial and the salaried and middle-income groups. The article also emphasizes the importance of the structural reforms applied, by arguing that it would have been impossible to meet the objectives of the Economic and Monetary Union without a substantial transformation of the European economy. Additionally, the article introduces a novel concept called “the paradox of financialization.” It refers to the increasing dependence of EU economies on the financial sector for economic growth, while the only way for the financial sector to expand is by engaging in riskier and more speculative practices. Consequently, this situation makes economic growth more unstable and cycles more volatile. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

a potential instability that follows from a maturity mismatch of assets

the stability of the financial sector and find that an interbank market
stabilizes the economy during normal times but amplifies systemic
instability, contagion and bankruptcy cascades during crises. But even
with no interbank market, indirect contagion can lead to bankruptcy
cascades. The authors also find that the existence of large banks

abstract = {This paper addresses the question of whether a capitalist economy can ever sustain a 'stationary' (or non-growing) state, or whether, as often claimed, capitalism has an inherent 'growth imperative' arising from the charging of interest on debt. We outline the development of a dedicated system dynamics macro-economic model for describing Financial Assets and Liabilities in a Stock-Flow consistent Framework (FALSTAFF) and use this model to explore the potential for stationary state outcomes in an economy with balanced trade, credit creation by banks, and private equity. Contrary to claims in the literature, we find that neither credit creation nor the charging of interest on debt creates a 'growth imperative' in and of themselves. This finding remains true even when capital adequacy and liquidity requirements are imposed on banks. We test the robustness of our results in the face of random variations and one-off shocks. We show further that it is possible to move from a growth path towards a stationary state without either crashing the economy or dismantling the system. Nonetheless, there remain several good reasons to support the reform of the monetary system. Our model also supports critiques of austerity and underlines the value of countercyclical spending by government. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Young households seem to be less familiar with the concept of inflation, while retirees are less familiar with the concepts of compound interest and risk diversification.

abstract = {"Arrested Development" investigates a series of monetary crises in the US and Mexico in the late 1960s and 1970s to explain how and why government officials in both countries abandoned postwar growth projects in favor of neoliberal development projects, despite the slower growth, lower real wages, rising social instabilities and more frequent market failures that emerged as a result. The project demonstrates that US and Mexican officials formulated and implemented domestic and foreign policies based on their perceptions of the political and economic costs and benefits of the various policy programs they considered, rather than on a growing faith in neoliberal ideas, as other scholars have suggested. US and Mexican authorities, even those in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and Miguel de la Madrid, both fervent supporters of free market ideas, were quick to formulate policy that ran contrary to their principles when indulging their beliefs threatened to place them at a political disadvantage. Instead, neoliberal ideas rose to prominence in the 1970s because they became politically useful, performing an essential ideological function that legitimated the development projects and the state authorities who implemented them, even when the policy initiatives diverged from neoliberal principles. Through its focus on the pragmatic politics of growth and development, this dissertation explains the origins of the neoliberal development projects that proliferated around the world in the late twentieth century, providing a new periodization of neoliberalism and a historical and analytical specificity to a widely used but poorly historicized term.},

@phdthesis{Berglund2005,
abstract = {We develop in this dissertation an integrated, flexible system of macroeconomic accounting and modeling. The hallmark of the system is that its accounting framework is stock-flow consistent, meaning that it accounts exhaustively for all stocks of assets in the economy, and that it connects every asset to corresponding flows of property income, investment and holding gains. The accounting system takes the form of an interrelated set of social accounting matrices (SAMs), into which stocks and flows of funds are fitted as continuous-time variables. The nominal value of each variable is decomposed into prices and volumes in a way that secures consistency in aggregation as well as “self-duality” (i.e., that prices × volumes = nominal values). This is accomplished by means of Divisia integral chain indices.    The accounting framework is brought to life by a set of differential equations describing the economic behavior of the agents of the model economy. These equations can be specified in different ways in order to achieve different “closures” of the model, subject to the same set of accounting restrictions. The model featured in the dissertation serves mainly as an example of how this can be done; it is not intended as a conclusive statement about the “right” way to model an economy.    The distinguishing feature of the modeling system is that the behavioral specifications are cast in terms of growth rates and “contributions to growth” rather than levels of prices and volumes. Levels are obtained through numerical evaluation of the integrals of the growth rates. The resulting integrals are path-dependent and thus not expressible in closed form. This novel approach secures consistency between the model and the underlying data, in the sense that both are based on the chain-index principle, in line with recent official statistical practice.},

We analyze the relationship between the personal and the functional income distribution in our sample, before disentangling their effects on the current account. A consistent finding is that rising (top-end) personal inequality leads to a decrease of the current account, controlling for standard current account determinants. By contrast, a fall in the share of wages in national income leads to an increase in the current account. We further analyze how different measures of income distribution affect the financial balances of the household, corporate and government sectors and discuss potential theoretical explanations of our findings. We conclude that changes in personal and functional income distribution have contributed considerably to the widening of current account balances, and hence to the instability of the international economic system, prior to the global financial crisis starting in 2007. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The present work aims at contributing to the recent stream of literature which attempts to link the Neo-Schumpeterian/Evolutionary and the Post-Keynesian theory. The paper adopts the Post-Keynesian Stock Flow Consistent modeling approach to analyze the process of development triggered by the emergence of a new-innovative productive sector into the economic system. The model depicts a multi-sectorial economy composed of consumption and capital goods industries, a banking sector and two households sectors: capitalists and wage earners. Furthermore, it provides an explicit representation of the stock market. In line with the Schumpeterian tradition, our work highlights the cyclical nature of the development process and stresses the relevance of the finance-innovation nexus, analyzing the feed-back effects between the real and financial sides of the economic system. In this way we aim at setting the basis of a comprehensive and coherent framework to study the relationship between technological change, demand and finance along the structural change process triggered by technological innovation.

abstract = {Abstract              This article examines public debates on the legitimacy of banking profits in the 2008 credit crunch. A content analysis of 957 newspaper articles published in Germany and the UK in the early weeks after the Lehman Brothers collapse examines critical statements directed at illegitimate forms of financial profit in order to identify the cultural legitimacy of financial capitalism. The conceptual framework provided by the French sociology of justification points to the role of shared orders of value as a normative reference for public discourses. In both national debates, four important boundaries for legitimate profits were drawn that concerned the problems of ownership, risk-management capacities of traders, fraudulent client relations, and speculative gambling. The meaning of this classical moral criticism of banks was transformed in the context of the 2008 crisis: a line between "normal" and "excessive" financial profits was drawn, defining an area of legitimate profit-seeking that hewed to the basic assumptions of the market model. Economic theory was used as a scheme of public economic morality. The seemingly harsh critical debate effectively reproduced a legitimate image of a functioning financial market, deflecting public attention away from the structural ambivalences of financial profit-seeking and granting legitimacy to the institutional status quo of financial capitalism.},

Our model, inspired in the classical tradition, provides support for the assertion that an exchange rate policy aiming to improve national competitiveness and to bring about a sustained trade surplus is a viable option. In fact, the success of this strategy does not depend on the effectiveness of monetary sterilization - as many Argentinean heterodox authors claim - but on the ability to overcome the boundaries imposed by the evolution of the domestic wage rate and the potential emergence of competitive devaluations. In the particular case of Argentina, the introduction of export taxes on land-intensive commodities, in which the economy has absolute advantages, brings an additional policy tool that can make both the exchange rate target and the workers claims consistent.

In response, I develop geographical perspectives on knowledge and learning to situate business education within broader landscapes of corporate knowledge circulation, production and learning.

abstract = {Aid is said to be fungible at the aggregate level if it raises government expenditures by less than the total amount. This happens when the recipient government decreases domestic revenue, decreases net borrowing, or when aid bypasses the budget. This study makes three contributions to both fungibility and fiscal response literature. First, fungibility at the aggregate level is re-examined on a larger recent panel 1980–2012, distinguishing between short- and long-term impact of aid. The results indicate that aid is partly fungible in the long run and highly fungible in the short run. Second, to account for aid bypassing the budget, technical cooperation is used as a proxy for off-budget aid. Off-budget aid is found to be non-fungible and on-budget aid is partly fungible. Third, fungibility of bilateral and multilateral aid is analyzed: the results indicate lower fungibility of multilateral aid. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd},

abstract = {This chapter develops a dynamic general equilibrium model that is intended to help clarify the role of credit market frictions in business fluctuations, from both a qualitative and a quantitative standpoint. The model is a synthesis of the leading approaches in the literature. In particular, the framework exhibits a "financial accelerator", in that endogenous developments in credit markets work to amplify and propagate shocks to the macroeconomy. In addition, we add several features to the model that are designed to enhance the empirical relevance. First, we incorporate money and price stickiness, which allows us to study how credit market frictions may influence the transmission of monetary policy. In addition, we allow for lags in investment which enables the model to generate both hump-shaped output dynamics and a lead-lag relation between asset prices and investment, as is consistent with the data. Finally, we allow for heterogeneity among firms to capture the fact that borrowers have differential access to capital markets. Under reasonable parametrizations of the model, the financial accelerator has a significant influence on business cycle dynamics. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract              The paper argues that contemporary capitalism must be studied as a society rather than an economy, and contemporary society as capitalist society. Capitalism is defined as a specific institutionalization of economic action in the form of a specifically dynamic system of social action, with a tendency to expand into, impose itself on and consume its non-economic and non-capitalist social and institutional context, unless contained by political resistance and regulation. The paper illustrates its perspective by four brief sketches, depicting contemporary capitalism as a historically dynamic social order, a culture, a polity, and a way of life. All four examples, it is claimed, demonstrate the superiority of a longitudinal-historical approach over static cross-sectional comparisons, and of focusing on the commonalities of national versions of capitalisms rather than their "varieties".

abstract = {The effects of the introduction of a government sector in Kaldor-Pasinetti models of growth and income distribution are discussed.  If there is enough capital mobility to ensure the uniformity of the rate of return on all capital and the capitalists are the thriftiest category, the resulting equilibrium rate of profits will always be equal to the ratio of the natural rate of growth to the capitalists' net propensity to save, notwithstanding the existence of an unbalanced budget.  The introduction of a government is not merely a special case of Pasinetti's analysis of many groups of savers, since the government has characteristics that make it totally different from any other economic agent.  In particular, its singular saving behavior is best illustrated by the fact that its propensity to save may assume both positive and negative values.},

the impact of negative surprises, especially in the low states of

abstract = {In connection with the strengthening and enlargement of financial markets, i.e., financialization, financial services and products play a major role in the everyday lives of consumers. One drawback of this trend is the increase in the number of debt problems. The data used in this article consist of Finnish district-court judgments related to debt that in most cases was consumption-related, and register-based data on debtors. We first compare debtors to the entire population of Finland by age, gender, marital status, and education, and also in different age groups. The focus then turns to the four most common types of debt in the judgments (based on consumer credit, operator services, distance selling, and credit card debts), and how age, gender, marital status, and education related to these debt types. According to the results, consumers under 30 years of age, in particular, men, those with a basic level of education, and the divorced were over-represented in the data, compared to the overall Finnish population. Young single adults were particularly likely to have accrued smaller amounts of debt related to instant loans and operator services, whereas more extensive consumer credit as well as credit card debt tended to be a problem among retirees. Credit card debt, as well as debts to lending firms, were more common among those with tertiary education than among those with a basic education. Overall, the adverse effects of financialization focused especially on young people with a low level of education. The results also indicate that legislation could partly reduce the negative effects of financialization.},

Unlike many previous studies, I focus on the causal link between the degree of financial deepening and economic growth in order to discriminate between several alternative theoretical hypotheses. To that end, I use multivariate Granger-causality tests within an error-correction framework. The results generally support the view that financial deepening is a necessary causal factor of economic growth, although the strength of the evidence varies across countries and across the proxies used to measure financial deepening. The causal relationships are also predominately long-term in nature. Therefore, government policies aimed at promoting financial deepening in these countries must be persistent and sustainable in order to foster economic development. [E44, O11, O16]},

Although economists have calculated the price of a systemic liquidity put as a liability of government--which becomes very high at moments like 2008--they do not take into account forms of political action that increase uncertainty about whether government will provide the guarantee, and in what form, if any, it will demand to be repaid.

It finds that Japan's seemingly high household saving rate is biased due to the exclusion of capital transfers and real capital gains, the valuation of depreciation at historical cost rather than at replacement cost, the use of a residual measure of financial saving rather than Flow of Funds Accounts data thereon, and the treatment of expenditures on consumer durables as consumption rather than as saving, but that the biases are to a considerable extent mutually offsetting. It also finds that the Japan‐U.S. gap in household (personal) saving rates is due largely to conceptual differences and deficiencies and that household saving in Japan consists primarily of financial saving (net lending), meaning that most of it is available to finance investment in other sectors of the economy and/or abroad.

This compilation method is recommended in the International Monetary Fund's manual on quarterly national accounts as the preferred method to compile quarterly national accounts data consistent with an existing set of annual national accounts. Furthermore, the article reviews some of the empirical evidence on the business cycle and the linkages between the financial sector and the real economy in the Danish post-war period that can be uncovered from the new data-set.},

abstract = {This paper argues that a fundamental aspect of the process of financialization is the transformation and evolution of certain key institutions. In national spaces, these include those that play essential roles in financing economic activity, such as the central bank and the commercial banking sector, and also the institutions that determine the quantity and form of public expenditure. In Latin American countries, these changes have reduced the possibilities of national authorities to influence financial processes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Financial variables such as cash flow and cash stocks are robust and
quantitatively important explanatory variables for investment at the
firm level. A large body of recent empirical work attributes these
findings to capital-market imperfections. This interpretation is
controversial, however, because even in the absence of capital-market
imperfections, such financial variables may appear as an explanatory
variable for investment if they contain information about the expected
marginal value of capital. In this paper, we show how structural models
of investment with costly external finance can be used to identify and
quantify the fundamental vs, the financial determinants of investment.
Our empirical results show that investment responds significantly to
both fundamental and financial factors. Point estimates from our
structural model imply that, for the average firm in our sample,
financial factors raise the overall response of investment to an
expansionary shock by 25{\%}, relative to a baseline case where financial
frictions are zero. Consistent with theory, small firms and firms
without bond ratings show the strongest response to financial factors,
while bond-rated firms show Little if any response, once we control for
investment fundamentals.},

@phdthesis{Elhiraika1991,
abstract = {There has been a marked resurgence of academic interest on the theory of finance and growth in Less Developed Countries (LDCs) over the last two decades. It is currently more widely believed among economists that the development of the financial and capital markets of a developing country would enhance the growth of its real economic activities. Meanwhile, with external capital increasingly running short of LDCs1 expectations, reliance on domestic sources of finance is becoming more critical than ever before.    Sudan, unlike most LDCs, is a country with huge untapped natural resources. Yet, its development plans have consistently been frustrated by the inadequacy of both internal and external sources of finance. This study concerns itself with the structure, nature, and performance of monetary and financial policies and institutions, and their role in development financing in Sudan. As such, it attempts to make an empirical contribution to the literature on finance and development in LDCs.    It is argued in this study that the extent to which financial variables may influence real variables, would depend on how well-suited financial institutions and instruments are to provide development finance as well as non-finance or equity-related services. Serious doubt is cast on the ability of liberalized interest rates to bring about such a financial structure, and on the capacity of an unregulated financial system to allocate resources in an economically efficient way.    The financial system of Sudan, which is bank-based, has little contribution to term and/or equity financing, entrepreneurial development, and enterprise initiatives. But, ill-studied monetary and credit policies, associated with considerable fiscal imbalances, and accelerating inflation, are partly to blame for inadequate development and performance of financial intermediaries. In particular, the long-term development of financial and capital markets has been overrode by the quest for short-term economic stabilization.    The study is particularly timely and significant considering the socio-economic, and legislative developments that have occurred in Sudan during the late 1970s and the 1980s. The most important of these developments is the renaissance of Islamic ideals, which is manifested in the establishment of various banks and non-bank financial intermediaries that adhere to Islamic principles of finance. The cornerstone of these principles is the abolition of predetermined rates of interest. We examine the theory of Islamic finance, and provide an empirical assessment of the performance of Islamic banks in Sudan, pinpoint their limitations and suggest a basis for future policy. It has been argued in this study that Islamic banking in particular poses a series of problems, which urge fundamental restructuring of financial and capital markets, as well as the regulatory and supervisory apparatuses.    While the Islamic modes of finance, which call for participation and increased involvement of financial firms in various aspects of business, may boost the rate of real capital formation and the growth of entrepreneurship, they have an ambiguous impact on saving accumulation. Moreover, the Islamic instruments of finance tend to be less liquid than conventional ones, and may entail substantial costs to banks. We demonstrate that for Islamic finance to be successful there needs to be a well-functioning securities market.    Finally, it is shown, in the context of a macroeconomic model of the Sudanese economy, that a low and stable rate of inflation is critical for monetary or fiscal expansion to have predictable effects on real output growth, and that policies to stimulate aggregate demand and output should at the same time attempt to improve the supply side of the economy in order to reduce inflationary repercussions.},

abstract = {Less a comprehensive survey than an inquiry into discrete but articulated moments in Anglophone poetry from 1947 to 2007, this dissertation examines the emergence and enduring legacy of Black Mountain Poetry and the British Poetry Revival with close attention to the triangulated transatlantic relationship between Charles Olson, Edward Dorn and J.H. Prynne. For each of these poets questions concerning the mutually constitutive character of political economy, cultural production and constructions of space were at all times primary if not always front and center. Writing during the zenith and through the twilight of Fordism, Olson's philologically oriented poetics immediately informed the work of Dorn and Prynne, but the extent to which Dorn and Prynne draw from Olson's accomplishment is far from passive. Rigorously recalibrating Olson's process-based projective poetics to suit the demands of their own moment, Dorn and Prynne aspire on the terrain of the cultural to attend to the failures that signal the decline of Fordism and the concurrent ascendancy of flexible accumulation from the late 1960s onward. As such, their work engages a rich variety of shared concerns later taken up by poets associated with a wide range of radical tendencies in writing such as Language Writing, New Narrative and a considerable number of other poetries identified with the Bay Area, New York, London and Cambridge University. Without overstating the influence of Olson, Dorn and Prynne on subsequent writing practices, this project locates their work within a genealogy of poetic responses to questions concerning the relation of language and space to the shifting coordinates of economic accumulation from the postwar period of high Fordism through to the economic collapse that so violently punctuated the first decade of the twenty-first century.},

The past decade has borne witness to sharp swings in asset prices and a large expansion in$\backslash$ncredit and balance sheets. This paper considers a flow-of-funds approach that stresses the role of$\backslash$nasset prices, credit and balance sheets. This framework is used to shine a different light on the$\backslash$nGreat Moderation in the United Kingdom. It suggests that there were linkages between many of the$\backslash$nmacroeconomic puzzles of the day and the balance sheet developments that led to financial$\backslash$ninstability. It further argues that approaches to macroeconomics that stress the importance of$\backslash$nbalance sheet linkages might be helpful in spotting building financial fragility.},

abstract = {This paper studies the estate tax in a quantitative framework with business investment, borrowing constraints, estate transmission, and wealth inequality. We find that the estate tax has little effect on the saving and investment decisions of small businesses, but does distort the decisions of larger firms, thereby reducing aggregate output and savings. Removing such distortions by eliminating the estate tax does not necessarily imply that everyone would be better off. If other taxes were raised to reestablish fiscal balance, those at the top of the wealth distribution would experience a large welfare gain, but most of the population would lose.

We use simple bibliometric analysis to survey this literature. The crisis brought the nexus into question which is why we begin by reviewing the impact of the crisis on the pre-crisis consensus in the immediate aftermath of the crisis (2008–2014). Then, we review the evolution of the finance growth nexus after 2014. We discuss the current state of the pre-crisis consensus, and highlight the main features of the new consensus. We also propose a review of the methodological aspects of this recent literature, the econometrics of finance and growth in particular. Finally, we identify the actual limitations of literature and the key issues remaining unresolved which suggests avenues for future research.},

Our classification points to a rethinking of economic performance under alternative exchange rate regimes.

@article{Fontana2016,
abstract = {The paper starts with a brief criticism of macroeconomic analyses of different schools of thought for their focus on economic growth and maximisation of output. This applies to the traditional Keynesian approach, which has focused on the achievement of sufficient aggregate demand to underpin full employment and full capacity utilisation, down-playing aggregate supply constraints. This also applies to the neoclassical approach, including the current New Consensus Macroeconomics approach, which asserts the dominant role of aggregate supply in the long run, and where growth is set by the so-called 'natural rate of growth', with no concerns over environmental and ecological issues. The paper then proposes a different approach to macroeconomic analysis. It explicitly acknowledges that economic growth is a double-edged sword. Growth can help to alleviate persistent levels of high unemployment, but it can also lead to potentially catastrophic environmental problems. Building on the Monetary Circuit theory and the Demand-led growth theory, the paper offers an analysis of the interconnections and interdependence of the economic, biophysical and social worlds and by doing it hopes to provide the building blocks for the establishment of post-Keynesian ecological macroeconomics. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews the substantive issue of monetary union through evaluating countries readiness for entry utilising the experience of the European Union's process of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The European single currency system came under unprecedented strain following the Global Financial Crisis induced Great Recession and there is little reason to assume that this will diminish, in any significant way, in the near future. Crucially it is important to reflect that each economy is unique in its blend of sectoral strengths and weaknesses and comparative advantage, therefore the national interest will be distinctively different for each potential participant. In particular, there is no set rule in which to weigh the relative merits of the arguments associated with membership of a monetary union. In terms of the eurozone the chapter critically evaluates the convergence criteria stipulated in the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and empirically reviews the compliance of EU member states. It questions whether the TEU criteria satisfactorily perform this role, such that the convergence criteria present a series of financial tests, of which some are theoretically spurious, while the remainder are inadequate to indicate the range of consequences of participation. Finally, the chapter undertakes an analysis of the macroeconomic performance of Greece. Specifically, it focuses on the main features, economic events and key economic indicators (GDP per capita, inflation, unemployment, twin deficit of current account and net lending/borrowing, output gap and gross debt) during the crucial 2000-09 period, between eurozone membership and the crisis. {\textcopyright} 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract = {In this paper, we build a generalized two-sector Kaleckian growth model and explore the dynamics towards long-run positions. The model incorporates conflicting claims of labour and firms over income distribution and endogenous labour-saving technical progress. Adopting a stock-flow consistent framework, our simulation experiments yield the following results. First, the ‘paradox of thrift' and the ‘paradox of costs' hold, meaning that lower saving rates generate higher growth rates while higher real wages generate higher profit rates, but the magnitude of the impact depends on the initial status of income distribution and monetary policy. Second, changes in autonomous labour-saving innovations might explain the phenomenon of the ‘New Economy' of the second half of the 1990s within an alternative framework. Our simulations with a two-sector model retrieve the analytical results achieved with a one-sector Kaleckian model, with the addition of path dependence. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {In contrast to the traditional theory that financial market development is not possible during financial repression, this thesis demonstrates that it can occur under the right circumstances. In particular, the thesis shows that this occurred in the case of Mexican equity market development during the severe financial repression of 1982-1989. From an historical perspective, it demonstrates that industrial groups have contributed to the mobilization of resources for early industrialization. Although the existence of strong industrial groups or cartels can hinder financial liberalization when credit markets are severely repressed, the existence of such groups may stimulate the development of non-credit based financing.    The methods employed include both a broad historical review of the Mexican financial system from the perspective of the New Institutional Economics and a microeconometric analysis. Emphasis is given in the historical overview to the period 1982-1990 in which financial markets were repressed and commercial banks were State-owned. In this respect, it identifies the social, political, and economic factors inherent in Mexico's institutional framework which have enabled firms as well as government to overcome financial constraints and induce financial development via institutional change.    Central to the thesis is a quantitative analysis of a panel of 68 Mexican firms during the period 1978-1991. Statistical tests of institutional and financial characteristics of firm adjustment are realized through a continuously-phased period of three different financial regimes: financial boom, repression, liberalization.},
