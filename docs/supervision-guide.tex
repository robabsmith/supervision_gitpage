This is a simple GitBook to assist students to write projects in partial fulfilment of the requirements of a degree in economics at Aalborg University.

The content is updated periodically, and can NOT be referred to as an official source. All regulations and study program guides take presidence over any content on this site.

The content is also personalised to the extent that I provide some information about when I will personally be unavailable. Apart from that, it is my hope that at least some of the content will be useful to students of all level.

\hypertarget{introduction-to-supervision}{%
\chapter{Introduction to supervision}\label{introduction-to-supervision}}

This is an introduction text that explains that I will be your
supervisor for your project and outlines some guidelines for our
collaboration.

\hypertarget{the-introductory-letter---meeting-procedure-and-formalities}{%
\section{The introductory letter - Meeting procedure and formalities}\label{the-introductory-letter---meeting-procedure-and-formalities}}

\textbf{Supervision letter:}
This is a copy of the introductory mail that you received, modified slightly for variation in group sizes (and trimming some of the niceties).

To get started, let's get a few things done.

\hypertarget{to-do-list}{%
\subsection{To do list}\label{to-do-list}}

Step 1: Please make an MS Teams Team and invite me to it (as an owner).
Step 2: Make a plan for the first meeting. (See the info below)
Step 3: Figure out how you are going to work together (you cannot just divide up the project into small parts and each do a different part) - we'll discuss this in the first meeting.

In the first meeting I will be the moderator (i.e.~like a meeting-coordinator) - I will keep track of the time, make sure we talk about everything on the list, and try to let everyone have a chance to speak.

We need to discuss how you as a group are going to approach writing a project together. It is both an exciting and challenging process, part of the challenge is to get several individuals in the same room (teams for now I presume) where all group members can be heard, and can contribute to the development of the project.

To help with that, we are going to need to have some formalities in our meetings (otherwise I will just end up speaking far too much), and we won't achieve what needs to be done in the discussions.

\hypertarget{roles-and-responsibilities-in-the-meetings}{%
\subsection{Roles and responsibilities in the meetings}\label{roles-and-responsibilities-in-the-meetings}}

Formalities: for every meeting you need to as a group select the following 3 people:
(These need to be different for every meeting, but one person can take on multiple roles in smaller groups.)

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The person responsible for sending the agenda (talking points) before the meeting. (At least 1 day before the meeting.)
\item
  The note-taker for that meeting (Will be responsible for sending a summary of the meeting to everyone after the meeting).
\item
  The moderator for that meeting (will be responsible for keeping the meeting running on time and according to the agenda).
\end{enumerate}

Just as a suggestion: I will include a rather formal meeting agenda in the team files section that you can use to save some time setting up a meeting agenda each time. Just change the headings that you want to and then update the table of contents (right-click on it and click on ``update field'').

\hypertarget{rules-for-the-meetings-short-and-sweet}{%
\subsection{Rules for the meetings (short and sweet)}\label{rules-for-the-meetings-short-and-sweet}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Everyone is treated with respect.
\item
  When one person is talking, all other people must listen. Not just keep quiet, but actually listen to the suggestions / comments.
\end{enumerate}

I will share a supervision guide with you all once you have made the team, then we will use MS Teams to set up our meetings. I'll show you how to do this - I will also make an agenda for the first meeting, and ask everyone to send me points they would like raised.

Please make the MS Team, discuss among you who will do what role in the first meeting, and we can cover the rest once we meet.

Important notice:
The time have available for supervision are spread evenly through the semester, it is entirely your responsibility as a group to arrange to use the time allocated through the semester.

Best regards,
Robert Smith

\hypertarget{how-many-meetings}{%
\section{How many meetings?}\label{how-many-meetings}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Introductory meeting:} We will go through literature search and a
  few useful tools for writing in a collaborative project. (I will try to
  do a digital/video guide so that you can watch / view / pause rewind the
  info as much as you please.)
\end{enumerate}

Here I will also try to get to understand where you are as a group in
terms of 5 main areas:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Your subject specific knowledge (this till be in terms of the
  specific topic that you have chosen to work on).
\item
  Your experience and knowledge of group project work.
\item
  Your skills in project and process management for getting the job
  done.
\item
  Your technical academic skills -- Theory of science, methodology,
  methods and theory.
\item
  Your project writing skills -- The practical writing tools,
  reference mangers, programming skills, collaboration tools etc.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item
  \textbf{Meeting 2:} You need to have worked on and bring a complete
  problem statement (see the guide and tips below), we will discuss it in
  the first meeting.
\item
  \textbf{Meeting 3:} The literature review, and expected method should be
  done, and any data or materials you plan to use should be collected. We
  will go through your planned method and argumentation in the meeting.
\item
  \textbf{Meeting 4:} The analysis should be complete, and you should have
  some working points for your discussion / conclusions. We will go
  through your arguments verbally, and I will probe any major gaps I see
  in your thinking.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{language}{%
\section{Language}\label{language}}

As you can see from this text, my first language is English. So anyone
that wants to work on their English writing, or just get more exposure
to economics in English it might be a good opportunity for you -- If you
want to work outside of the country or in most multinationals here in DK
it is typically a requirement (Danmarks Nationalbank included). You will
not be assessed on your grammar, but you will need to make sense and
write in a professional manner.

If you would prefer to work in Danish, you are of course welcome to.

To get the most out of the supervision I recommend that in addition to
the introductory meeting, 3 group meetings should be sufficient.

\hypertarget{guidelines-for-supervision}{%
\chapter{Guidelines for supervision}\label{guidelines-for-supervision}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Any team member can communicate with me via Teams on behalf of your
  group. I expect that all communication has been discussed an
  agreed upon.
\item
  Just as you can expect me to read and provide comments on the days
  of meetings, I expect you to respect the deadlines you choose.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you want something read before the meeting, it must be sent
    to me \textbf{at least 2 working days before the meeting}, \textbf{I.e.
    Midnight Thursday for a Monday meeting}. (Max 10 pages per
    meeting)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  I will read and comment generally on the work but \textbf{will not make
  decisions for you}. Your ability to choose and apply the correct
  methods is part of what you will be assessed on.
\item
  Each meeting is planned for one hour.
\item
  \textbf{\underline{For every meeting you should bring with:}}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    Your problem statement (as it evolves with your work).
  \item
    A list of literature that you have covered up to that point
    (only the literature you have already read).
  \item
    Any additional formalities (this will depend on how big your
    group is).
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  The date by which you will be ready for the next meeting.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{examinations}{%
\section{Examinations}\label{examinations}}

You can write and be examined in Danish or English. If you choose
Danish, it might be the case that one of our Danish speaking staff will
join in the examination, 1x external examiner + me + possibly 1x Danish
AAU examiner. This will depend on departmental resources, but you will
not be disadvantaged in any way because of any limitations that I might
have with the Danish language.

\hypertarget{leave-periods-absenteeism}{%
\section{Leave periods (absenteeism)}\label{leave-periods-absenteeism}}

I will be away from Aalborg for the following periods:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  From 03/11/2021 to 07/11/2021 (week 44).
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{teaching-and-time-pressures}{%
\section{Teaching and time pressures}\label{teaching-and-time-pressures}}

Weeks 47 and 48 I will have a large number of lectures to teach, and will not be able to provide any feedback during those weeks.

\hypertarget{rough-guide-to-project-structures}{%
\section{Rough guide to project structures}\label{rough-guide-to-project-structures}}

This is a \textbf{very rough} guide to writing a project. It is intended to
give you a very basic idea of what to include in a good project.

In terms of pages, each group will know how many people they have, the
official \textbf{maximum number of pages} (by character count, 2400
key-strokes including spaces) are:

1 Person: 15 pages

2 People: 25 pages

3 People: 30 pages

4 People: 40 pages

\href{https://www.business.aau.dk/education/students}{Check the official guidelines here}

\textbf{Filling the pages is not the goal}, and you will not be given a
higher grade for filling all of your allocated pages with pointless
text. You will also not be penalised if you can get your message across
clearly in fewer pages. Keep in mind, that the average journal article
is roughly 15 -- 25 double spaced pages (around 8000 words).

You only need to address \textbf{one} problem, and to do it as well as
possible.

The written project is intended \textbf{to communicate} that you have done
your homework on your subject. This means that as a student \textbf{you should
be able to demonstrate that you}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Can identify an economic problem (or gap in the literature) that you
  think needs to be addressed (and why?!).
\item
  Can find, read and understand literature about the problem, and how
  others have dealt with it (reading and organising literature).
\item
  Can find the relevant information or data that you need to assess
  the problem, and that you know what to do with it when you do find
  it (number 2 helps with this) (data and methods).
\item
  Can present your findings in a well written document, where you give
  credit to all the authors that helped you to understand the
  problem (references).
\item
  If you make a statement, you either need to back it up with your own
  evidence, or someone else's.
\end{enumerate}

Compressing all of that into 8000 words is much more challenging than
filling 40 pages with unnecessary text and graphics. It also requires
much more cooperation on and discussion of what needs to go into those
pages to make them as effective as possible.

A good group member is one that can read a piece of writing critically
and give constructive feedback -- to do this effectively is necessary
for all group members to be clear about the ``red thread'' in the project
(the ``why'').

\textbf{I would personally prefer that you write about 15 pages of really good
work than 40 pages of low-quality work.}

\hypertarget{for-a-journal-article-size-paper-these-are-some-rough-guidelines}{%
\section{For a journal article size paper these are some rough guidelines:}\label{for-a-journal-article-size-paper-these-are-some-rough-guidelines}}

The share of pages between the sections depends on how much space you
\emph{need}. I say \emph{need}, because people reading your work want to get the
clearest message, in as few words as possible. A (very) rough guide as
to how many (academic) references each section could have is included in
red text.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Abstract (+-150 words)
\item
  Introduction (0.75 -- 1.25 pages) (Motivation, justification,
  explanation of why? (4 -- 5 references))
\item
  Literature / theory (1.5 -- 3 pages, depending on how theoretical
  your paper is) (Demonstrate reading (6 -- 12 references))
\item
  Method (0.75 -- 3 pages, depending on how complex the explanation
  needs to be) (Justify choice, explain details (4 -- 5 references))
\item
  Results (1 -- 3 pages) (Presentation of results (2 -- 5 references))
\item
  Discussion (2 -- 5 pages) (Interpretations, comparisons,
  perspectives (4 -- 5 references))
\item
  Conclusion (1 page) (Link discussion to introduction (No new
  references))
\end{enumerate}

(The max pages in this example is 16.5 pages -- it is just an example,
and the split between the sections will change depending on the type of
research.)

(Min references in this example is 20, but this is on the high side. You
won't have time to read as much as that. 8 -- 15 references in total
should be enough if you find some really good ones.)

Keep it simple! That is the best advice I ever got. . . and the hardest
to follow, because you really need to be sure of what you're talking
about to write clearly and simply.

\hypertarget{time-planning-and-limitations}{%
\chapter{Time planning and limitations}\label{time-planning-and-limitations}}

Be aware of the time you have left to do the research. Data /
information collection and organisation takes time, and you need to get
started on it early if you want to be able to say anything useful by the
time you finish writing your project up. If you are efficient in how you
work this guide might help:

\textbf{A brief guide:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Problem identification and reading: 1 week
\item
  Write literature review: 1 week
\item
  Write first draft of introduction: 2 days
\item
  Data collection: 1 week
\item
  Write method and methodology section: 3 days
\item
  Data cleaning and analysis: 2 weeks
\item
  Write results: 1 week
\item
  Write conclusion: 2 days
\item
  Re-write introduction: 2 days
\item
  Check document for references and errors: 1 day
\end{enumerate}

Total: 8 weeks. From mid-March this would get you to mid-May, or from
mid-September it would take you to mid-November.

The later you start, the later you finish, or\ldots{} if you have a
deadline\ldots{} the more you have to sacrifice in terms of quality.

Remember to add time for:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Reading and feedback
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{reverse-time-planning}{%
\section{Reverse time-planning}\label{reverse-time-planning}}

A very powerful way to plan your project is to take the delivery date
and work backwards.

Pick your delivery date, and then work out how much time you need for
each of the jobs you need to do -- but starting from the last job first.

I will also share a project planner with you all when we have shared
supervision space established.

\hypertarget{guide-for-report-writing}{%
\chapter{Guide for report writing}\label{guide-for-report-writing}}

Author: \emph{Verena Stingl}

\hypertarget{structuring-your-report}{%
\section{Structuring your report}\label{structuring-your-report}}

While there are many ways to structure your report, there is typically
an underlying logic related to how you ``tell a compelling story'' in
any of these reports. The typical story flow is the following:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{images/story_flow.png}
\caption{Story flow}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{general-recommendations}{%
\section{General recommendations}\label{general-recommendations}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{A report is not a mystery novel}. Never leave the reader wondering
  why they are reading about some topic or why they should care.
  That means:
\item
  Start your report on point with introducing the specific problem
  area, and what makes that area problematic. E.g. \emph{``Day-to-day delivery operations operate under high fluctuations in demand. This variability creates challenges for both efficient stock keeping and staff planning, when actual needs are known less than 24h before they should be met.''}
\item
  Give an outlook how you will help understand and overcome the
  challenge, i.e.~what the reader can expect to get out of this
  report.
\item
  When you introduce a new section or theme, tell the reader why
  this is important - especially in the ``literature'' or
  ``theory'' section. E.g. \emph{``Day-to-day delivery operations can cope with demand fluctuation through three approaches: improving forecasts, working with buffers, or increasing flexibility in their processes. In the following we are introducing these three approaches and under which condition they are sensible strategies, and thereafter will discuss them in the context of our case company.''}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{define-your-golden-thread-ruxf8d-truxe5d}{%
\section{Define your golden thread (rød tråd)}\label{define-your-golden-thread-ruxf8d-truxe5d}}

This should ideally be done before starting detail writing
and make sure that it does not make twists and loops. A report
should have a clear argumentative structure, that means:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If a section does not help the reader to understand better what
  the problem is, what you did to tackle it, or what your
  problem solution really is, it probably has no place in the
  report.
\item
  If a section requires knowledge from later in the report to be
  understandable, it is probably badly placed
\item
  If you cannot formulate a conclusion regarding the current
  section that will build a bridge to what you will tell in the
  next section(s), it is probably not necessary to have that
  section.
\item
  If a section repeats what has been written earlier in the
  report, you should probably cut down on the redundancies
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{create-signposts}{%
\section{Create signposts}\label{create-signposts}}

It is massively helpful for the flow of the text
to start a section with a purpose statement, and conclude it with
some sort of summary. However, there are good and bad ways to do
it.

Good ways to start provide the reader with a frame in which they can
``mentally'' place the details provided later in the section. Bad ways
just state the obvious and take up space. For example:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  BAD way to start a section: \emph{``The purpose of this section is to
  introduce the methodology and give an overview of the collected
  data.''} does not tell you anything that a section header could
  have implied; does not connect to what has been written before.
\item
  GOOD way to start a section: \emph{``To investigate this problem further, we relied on a combination of qualitative and quantitative data collection methods that provided insights on the current warehousing practices. Specifically we\ldots{}''} \(\rightarrow\) links to the previous
  section (i.e.~the problem introduced before), gives an outlook on
  what will be covered (``qualitative and quantitative data collection methods'') and why this is relevant (to understand more
  about the current warehousing practices).
\end{itemize}

Good ways to end provide the reader with a reminder of the most
important points of the section, and how it relates both to the
general theme and to what will come after. Bad ways, again, just state
the obvious and take up space. For example:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  BAD way to end a section: \emph{``In this section we have presented the theory on forecasting, buffering, and flexible process design.''}
  \(\rightarrow\) tells nothing more than a section heading would have told you.

\hypertarget{make-convincing-claims}{%
\section{Make convincing claims}\label{make-convincing-claims}}

Especially in the introduction, you have
to make claims about the case company or the industry that they are
working in, for example regarding trends, or specific challenges or
problems. In this section you want to persuade the reader that they
should care, so make sure that your claims are convincing and
specific (e.g.~by using numbers or quotes instead of mere
descriptions and by referencing to trustworthy sources). For
example:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Unconvincing claim: ``\emph{Demand in construction material has skyrocketed}'' What does ``skyrocket'' mean? Where and when has
  demand increased? What's covered by construction material?
\item
  Convincing claim: "\emph{Due to increased home renovations during the Corona pandemic, the demand for construction material in Denmark has increased by X\% (of sales volume in DKK) in Q1 2021 compared to Q1 2020 (REFERENCE TO SOURCE). While all types of construction material have seen a rise in demand, the groups {[}material 1{]}, {[}material 2{]} and {[}material 3{]} have had the highest increase by X\%, Y\%, and Z\%."}
\item
  Unconvincing claim: \emph{``The most important aspect to manage when introducing green policies are social issues''} What is meant by ``social issues'' and ``green policies''? Who does the managing? Why exactly is it important (and more so than other aspects)?
\item
  Convincing claim: \emph{``To reduce overall green-house gas emissions within a society, policies need to address technological, economic, and social issues (REFERENCE TO RELIABLE SOURCE). Social issues here refer to the potential (negative) consequences of these policies for some groups within society, or all people in society. Fears of such negative consequences could trigger substantial civil opposition to these policies, even as technological solutions become increasingly available. Acknowledging this risk, EU commission's vice-president Frans Timmermans recently stated in an interview with the Guardian\emph{
  `{[}We{]} should make the social issue the pivotal issue in all of this. {[}..{]} This could become the biggest stumbling block' }(REFERENCE TO INTERVIEW).''}

You will not be given a higher grade for filling all of your allocated pages with pointless text. You will also not be penalised if you can get your message across clearly in fewer pages.

\hypertarget{dont-try-to-save-the-world}{%
\section{Don't try to save the world}\label{dont-try-to-save-the-world}}

You only need to address one well-scoped problem, and address it in a manner that
is reasonable in relation to your time and skill. Thus, you will
have to make decisions on what aspects of the problem area you
focus on, and which areas you will not tackle in your project.

Similar you will make decisions regarding which solution paths to
follow and which to abandon. Clearly articulate your decisions,
mention briefly those aspects/solutions that you are aware of but
have decided not to investigate (either in the problem definition
and/or in the discussion). Don't write long theoretical sections
on issues/approaches that were out of scope for you! For example:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the problem statement: \emph{"There are a number of known barriers to the adoption of digital technologies in manufacturing, typically grouped as technical, structural, and cultural barriers {[}REFERENCE{]}. For this project, we focus only on technical barriers in our solution development. However, we will consider potential implications of structural and cultural barriers in the discussion of this report.}"
\item
  Concluding the theory section: \emph{``Advanced forecasting techniques can be a promising approach to manage demand fluctuation in context where {[}CONTEXTS WHERE IT WORKS{]}. However, as we have described in the company background, {[}case company{]}'s demand is driven by {[}DIFFERENT FACTORS{]}. Thus, we will focus instead on approaches related to increasing the process flexibility as an alternative approach to handle their daily demand fluctuations.''}
\item
  In the discussion: \emph{``Our project has helped to identify the main technological barriers for the adoption of {[}technology X{]} in {[}case company{]}. We have made several propositions how to overcome these technological barriers in moving forward in their digitalization, such as {[}EXAMPLES{]}. However, our propositions have not yet considered structural and cultural barriers, such as the fit of the technology with current processes and business models, or potential fear of changes related to the digitalization. Thus, in developing implementation plans for these propositions, we advise {[}case company{]} to investigate into potential barriers related to their organizational structure and culture. Specifically, throughout our project, we have noted {[}\ldots{} your thoughts on these other barriers{]}''}

\section{Reading \& revising is just as important as writing}\label{reading-revising-is-just-as-important-as-writing}}

I will of
course read and comment on your report, but I will never go to the
detail level that you can provide to each other (and I will not
re-read sections on which I have commented earlier in the project).
So set time aside to read the sections of your colleagues (or assign
one or two of the group members the role of reviewer). Read
critically against questions such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Is the golden thread (rød tråd) clear?
\item
  Does the argument have a logical structure?
\item
  Are the claims convincing?
\item
  Is the language appropriate?
\item
  Is there text that serves no purpose?
\end{itemize}

Then give constructive feedback -- be specific and give examples (and be
nice). For example:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{``In the second paragraph you introduce {[}Theme X{]} but it is a bit
  unclear how this connects to the paragraph before. Maybe you could
  add\ldots{}''}
\item
  \emph{``I remember we had a quote from the production manager, we could
  use it to strengthen the argument you make here..''}

Coming up with a good question does not mean coming up with a question
that will change the world. It means coming up with a question that you
can answer \textbf{in the time you are allowed}, and \textbf{with the tools you
have (or have time to learn)}.

A note on how to get started with your problem selection -- try to be
curious. It is going to take some active effort.

\textbf{Most of you have identified an area of interest, rather than any
specific question.} These are just a few pointers to help you to
identify a good problem.

\tightlist
\item
  If you want to read a pretty good ``how-to'' guide, try this one:
  \url{https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Problem-Statement}
\end{itemize}

You need to actively apply yourselves to \emph{finding} a question:

\hypertarget{step-1-brainstorm-ideation}{%
\section{Step 1: Brainstorm / ideation}\label{step-1-brainstorm-ideation}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Find a meeting room and mind-map an area of economics that you are
  interested in.
\item
  A very high-level overview of the courses (like the table of
  contents in your textbooks) you have done so far should help you to
  understand the tools that you have, which you can use to answer
  whatever question you end up asking.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Some of these tools will be theories, models, data types and
    sources. The learning outcomes of your courses are also a good
    guide (check Moodle).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If you really want to be active in your search for problems, and
  deal with real life issues -- pick up a phone and make some calls to
  people in the area or industry you want to look at. These kinds of
  discussion can be really motivating and insightful.
\item
  As a group you can really benefit by getting ideas and input from
  each other. This does not need to take a long time but does require
  effort.
\item
  Don't get caught up by not deciding what to do -- get into a room,
  set a time frame and get finished with the choice early.
\end{itemize}

are related to innovation to products, but the general ideas can be used

\section{Step 2: Getting that problem statement clear}\label{step-2-getting-that-problem-statement-clear}}

\textbf{Where to start?}

Read. This starts with a good literature search.

Some reflective questions that I recommend you consider before the meeting:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{What are you investigating (you have a problem statement for this already - but it still lacks some clarity)?}\\
  i.e.
  What do you mean by: ``årsagen''?
  What do you mean by: ``handel med omverden''?
  How do you define globalisation?
  When you say ``påvirke'', what do you mean?\\
  ~\\
  Is it all people in the USA? All industries? Aggregate economic measures?\\
  When you talk about effects, it usually implies that there is some kind of causal relationship\ldots{} When looking at national economic aggregates - there are many possible ``causes'' for changes. Political, social, economic, technological, etc.
\item
  \textbf{Why is it important to investigate this?}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Who would care about this result? i.e.~why are you doing this research? what is the motivation behind finding an answer to this question?
  \item
    What is the problem that you are actually trying to throw some light on?
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{How have others explored this?}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    What did they find?
  \item
    What are some of the conclusions that have been drawn?
  \item
    Are there some concerns/issues with how other people have investigated it?
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{How could you possibly explore this question?}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    Are there some alternative explanations that have not been considered?
  \item
    Are there some other perspectives that have been ignored? For example\ldots{} if the USA is able to strengthen it's trade position, what are the consequences for smaller countries that compete in the same markets?
  \item
    Is there some new data available that illuminates a new part of the problem?
  \item
    Are there better measures available for inequality / trade performance / competitiveness / etc. ?
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{How are you going to make the choice about what road to take?}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \item
    If you had all the money and time in the world, how would you investigate this problem?
  \item
    What are the first steps / minimum requirements needed to be able to answer the question?
  \item
    What options are real possibilities in the time that is left?
  \item
    Who is going to do what?

A good introduction leads to a good problem statement, but this is only
possible if you have some good material to work with.

\hypertarget{example-flow-of-a-good-introduction}{%
\subsection{Example flow of a good introduction}\label{example-flow-of-a-good-introduction}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  You could list some shocking figures or numbers that highlight that
  there is some area / issue that we should be concerned about. It
  could also be some clear contradiction or controversy in the
  literature that needs clarification - but this requires some careful
  reading. (This defines the problem area that you want to address -
  normally these are the effects of some other problem that can be
  identified.)
\item
  You could then explain that some people see (explain) these
  facts/figures from the perspective of A / B / C . . . and conclude
  that X / Y / Z. Another group of researchers suggest that there may
  be another way to interpret these figures.. they say. . . etc. (This
  highlights existing theories in the literature - these could be
  conflicting explanations for the effects that are observed by
  different researchers. Always remember that research can have a
  particular agenda, i.e.~to promote efficiency of markets, or to
  critique main-stream literature - so be a little critical when
  reading. Every researcher is trying to sell their ideas.)
\item
  Next, you could explain that `these' different approaches suggest
  that this problem could be investigated by doing E/F/G.
  (Identification of possible ways of addressing the issue - There are
  a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods, and some people
  rely more on some than on others. This section should still be able
  to refer to how other people have addressed the issue. Here is where
  you narrow down what might be a good way to look at the problem.)
\item
  More specifically, therefore, we want to investigate how / if / what
  the effects of / etc. (By this stage you should be able to be
  specific about the exact part of the problem that you are interested
  in addressing, and all of the arguments for why it is interesting
  should already have been made.)
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{some-general-notes-about-writing-a-problem-statement}{%
\section{Some general notes about writing a problem statement}\label{some-general-notes-about-writing-a-problem-statement}}

The general structure of questions in most economic analyses is: What
is, has been, or will be the impact of \textbf{A} on \textbf{B}?

\hypertarget{where-do-you-find-a-problem-in-macroeconomics}{%
\subsection{Where do you find a problem in macroeconomics?}\label{where-do-you-find-a-problem-in-macroeconomics}}

Many economic queries attempt to measure social consequences, and most
often try to assign a financial value to those consequences. Sometimes
this is phrased as a ``comparative outcome'' or ``alternative scenario''.
Normally this means that one option is \emph{better} than another. This is
not surprising, since pretty much all macroeconomic variables are
aggregated financial values or derivatives thereof.

Other ways to frame a question could be:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Why is one option better than the other? How can you tell?
\item
  How does a change in X affect income for the economy / households /
  teachers?
\item
  How many people are employed?
\item
  Labour productivity?
\item
  How is the standard of living affected?
\end{enumerate}

These are justification options (evidence) to motivate \emph{why} an
investigation is a good idea. Just remember that you need to be able to
find the evidence to back up your arguments. As noted in the example of
an introduction flow above, your selection of a method should be the
logical conclusion of your reading.

\hypertarget{answering-the-why}{%
\subsection{Answering the Why?}\label{answering-the-why}}

Why is it that investigating this problem will be beneficial? To answer
the question generally requires awareness of:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  What?
\item
  When?
\item
  Where?
\item
  Who?
\item
  In what way?
\item
  How?
\end{enumerate}

These things are the specifics of the problem statement, but they will
not provide you with the answer to why it is important.

The best place to find an answer to \emph{why?} is to read some of the most
recent work on the topic you have found. Anything that has been
published has been read and edited by at least 5 people by the time it
goes to a journal. The arguments in those articles should therefore be
pretty reasonable.

Once you understand your \emph{why?} you can start with the specifics

\hypertarget{what}{%
\subsection{What?}\label{what}}

For example: If you chose to research currency markets, some of the
sub-categories could be (What?):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Trading platforms
\item
  Exchange rate policies
\item
  Regulations
\item
  Common currency areas
\item
  Clearing and settlement systems
\item
  Speculation
\item
  Risk-mitigation / hedging
\end{itemize}

This delimitation is often determined by the problem area that you
identify. Normally illustrated by something interesting or concerning,
which leads you to think that investigating the area might be
interesting.

You can go the other way around, and check what has been written about recently or is
currently being funded at the EU or national levels. Read some of the
latest literature relating to it and then identify if there is a similar
problem in an area that has not yet been investigated.

A third possibility is to open up some of the really amazing data
repositories of major institutions and see if some of those can inspire
you.

\hypertarget{when}{%
\subsection{When?}\label{when}}

You need to be carefully aware of what time period you choose to
investigate, as it has direct consequences for the types of conclusions
you can make from your analysis. If you look at 1950 -1970 consumption
data, you can't really say anything intelligent about the use of
disposable income in 2020.

Historical analysis is crucial in economics, but you should always be
aware of how the structure of the economies of the world have shifted
over time.

Education rates, the type of institutions that exist, levels of
unemployment, the size of government, etc.

A trendy catch phrase for this kind of context is PESTLE, an anagram for
how the context of countries change:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Political
\item
  Economic
\item
  Social
\item
  Technological
\item
  Legal
\item
  Environmental
\end{enumerate}

Please \textbf{don't write this list out and do a PESTLE analysis} in your
projects, it is just to tell you that there are many changes that take
place over time. And that you need to think specifically about time in
your problem statement.

\hypertarget{where}{%
\subsection{Where?}\label{where}}

This is quite obvious but is not only related to geographical borders.
For example, a study could be:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  National
\item
  Municipal
\item
  Regional
\item
  Global
\item
  Local (or micro)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{who}{%
\subsection{Who?}\label{who}}

Which groups are involved in your project, and who is it that will be
interested in reading the results of your research? Who will the
research / problem investigation be useful or interesting for.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Demographic specific (Ex., students, low-income families, employees
  at public institutions)
\item
  Institution specific (Ex. Banks, the national bank, the stock
  exchange, or one specific institution)
\item
  Industry specific (Ex. Mining, agriculture, home owners
  associations, mortgage institutes, or alternatively at a ``sector''
  level, such as households, firms, government etc.)
\item
  Country specific
\item
  Etc.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{in-what-way}{%
\subsection{In what way?}\label{in-what-way}}

You also need to know what kind of impact or relationship you are
looking for. Is it,

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{How much of the behaviour of A can be explained by B}?
\item
  Is it a \emph{theoretical or empirical issue} or are you interested in?
\item
  Or \emph{how much influence will A have on B? Or vice versa, or both}?
\item
  Is it causal? Are you arguing that one thing is \emph{causing} another
  thing? -- you have to be quite careful trying to do these ones.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how}{%
\subsection{How?}\label{how}}

Finally, you need to be able to explain how you are going to investigate
the problem. You should consider your tools and your course on
methodology (and philosophy of science) to be able to figure out how
will you answer the question.

You can boggle your brain a bit with the wiki-page on philosophy of
science here:

\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science}

Recall that methodology is layered, a very simplistic way to think about it is
as a hierarchy:

\begin{quote}
\textgreater{} Philosophy of science

-\textgreater{} Methodology

-\/-\textgreater{} Theory

-\/-\/-\/-\textgreater{} Methods
\end{quote}

\textbf{You can watch a few videos about what this is:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  This one is pretty good, but a little dry:
  \url{https://youtu.be/IvwkMxgahA4}
\item
  Daniel Hausman - This one has some interesting perspectives (but is
  much better in 2x speed): \url{https://youtu.be/EfF6WD8s_ps} (but he
  doesn't really list any specific philosophies)
\item
  Paul Hoyningen-Huene at Leibniz Universität Hannover has a whole
  course on it if you get really caught up in it -
  \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP8teUgZcBY\&list=PLGV2ddg-PFGvWKDeTyrUji7TXY8y1SHjl}
  (He is pretty entertaining and you could learn a lot in his course
  -- and have a few laughs at dad jokes -- in 22 lectures)
\item
  Marc Lavoie -- This might help if you are interested in locating the theory you are using in either heterodox or orthodox categories of economic methodology. Disclaimer: I do not believe this is a constructive way to categorise methodology, but it is a common way.
  \url{https://youtu.be/DEROFQIao4o}
\end{enumerate}

The philosophy of science defines what kind of results will be
considered valid. For example, is it valid to make a conclusion about
the future based on the past (i.e.~to use data to make predictions)?

Some examples of this are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Cartesian / Euclidian philosophies of science
\item
  The Babylonian mode of thinking
\item
  Critical realism
\item
  Scepticism
\item
  Logical positivism
\end{itemize}

This colour coded conceptual map of philosophy might put some of the
terms you come across into perspective (with some spin on ``education''):

\url{https://cmapspublic3.ihmc.us/rid\%3D1196256709922_36526043_8120/1196256715039I908793757I8261Iimage}

Theories use methods, and methods are part of a particular methodology,
and the methodology is made valid by the theory of science inside which
it fits.

Methods are at the bottom of the pyramid, and can be quantitative or
qualitative, or a combination of both. It is important to be aware of
what you are doing and using. They are normally used to motivate one or
another theory.

This stuff can be extremely dry and boring, or it can also be super
interesting (if you are into it). It is how we know, that we know, that
what we know, is really something factual -- or what a fact is in the
first place. It is closely related to metaphysics, epistemology and
ontology. None of which will help you cook an egg in the morning, but
you might find the study as fascinating as I do (even if I will never
suck up the energy to finish reading Immanuel Kant's \emph{Critique of Pure
Reason}).

This Saunders et al.~research onion is a pretty useful way to think
about each of the decisions we make when constructing out research.

\chapter{Alternative platforms for writing projects}\label{alternative-platforms-for-writing-projects}}

This is a brief list of options when writing a project. Some options are best suited to complex data work, such as Rmarkdown, whereas others are better suited to collaborative writing, such as Overleaf, MS Word via MS Teams.

Each of these platforms are presented in short videos below. There are some clear advantages to using some rather than others. For each you will need to have some knowledge about how the program works in order to use it, and this might require a time investment.

My preference is to recommend open-source options that allow for efficient collaboration and / or reproducible research.

\textbf{Free / open source options}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

Overleaf offers a number of excellent guides for getting started, but for those that would like an explanation from me of some of the basics, please feel free to watch the following videos.

One of the most powerful features of Overleaf is the ability to who any change is attributed to, and to roll back changes incrementally. This is possible due to the built in version control features that the platform offers.

\hypertarget{reference-and-bibliography-management}{%
\chapter{Reference and bibliography management}\label{reference-and-bibliography-management}}

With the aid of technology, it is not possible to very easily and efficiently manage and utilise the literature sources that you need when writing an academic project.

The first step is finding the appropriate literature, which is explained in more detail in the chapter below. This section is included in advance as it is useful to select the bibliography management software in advance of completing a literature search.

Each of the more popular reference management software tools have a variety of advantages and disadvantages, depending on what program you choose to work in.

My own preferences are shaped by my experience with each program - and a desire to make sure that the content I create will be accessible to me always, regardless of whether I am at the university or not. If better options exist I would be most interested in hearing about them.

The first two software options enable in-text referencing and automatic generation of reference lists in MS word. The last option, of manually collecting your reference data, is the most inefficient, but has some benefits. The videos below will link to the \href{https://www.loom.com}{Loom} hosting service, and provide a guide to Mendely. Refworks can do pretty much everything that Mendeley can, but it is expensive to use once you leave the university.

Debt to disposable income levels in several Danish sectors have risen to the highest ever recorded levels, while the Danish central bank (Danmarks nationalbank), the IMF and Finanstilsynet all report that there are no serious threats to financial stability. Financial deregulation, relaxation of borrowing criteria and product innovation have been cited as the leading causes of this trend. This thesis aims to explore credit creation and macro-financial risks related to the expansion of household debt in Denmark by examining institutional sector and individual household balance sheets.

\chapter{Presentations}\label{presentations}}

Each semester students approach me asking what ``I would prefer they present?''. This really is not a question of preference, but there seems to be enough inconsistency in expectations to make it worth while asking the supervisor what to do.

Some supervisors must have an expectation that something new is presented - or this would not arise as a question.

\hypertarget{first-and-foremost-check-the-learning-and-knowledge-objectives-for-the-project}{%
\section{First and foremost: Check the learning and knowledge objectives for the project!}\label{first-and-foremost-check-the-learning-and-knowledge-objectives-for-the-project}}

The only thing you can be graded against are the formal descriptions in the study or project description. These are often quite broad, but these are the grounds that need to be covered \textbf{at a minimum} for the project to pass.

These objectives can be met by either the written or the oral contibutions of the student. So if you have failed to complete part of the objectives in the written part - you might consider covering the ground in the presentation. Although this might not be the most effective strategy, since there is a good chance you will be asked questions that reflect those objectives in the question and answer part of your defence.

\hypertarget{so-what-is-the-purpose-of-the-presentation}{%
\section{So what is the purpose of the presentation?}\label{so-what-is-the-purpose-of-the-presentation}}

The presentation is an opportunity to communicate the contribution that you have made. It is also an opportunity to set the stage for the defence that follows.

Ideally you want to make an interesting and compelling presentation. Interesting in the sense that the content should be interesting to listen to, and compelling in the sense that you need to convince the people listening that you know what you are talking about.

That may seem like subjective and useless information - but first impressions matter, and a strong presentation that is well delivered creates a firm foundation for a good strong defence.

\hypertarget{something-old-or-something-new}{%
\section{Something old or something new?}\label{something-old-or-something-new}}

You each have 8-10 minutes to convince the examiner that you have done something interesting and or useful.

This could be presenting the work you have already submitted in written form - bearing in mind that the examiners will have read the project. This can be beneficial if the written project does not capture the full extent of the work and findings of the research. Although, you should also be able to explain why it was never included in the written part in the first place.

An example of this could be a complex economic model, with perhaps 50 or 100 equations - where a full explanation of all intricacies would result in a very (impractically) long document that failed to capture the main point of your research.

\hypertarget{its-about-communicating-value}{%
\section{It's about communicating value}\label{its-about-communicating-value}}

As mentioned above, it can help to think about the idea that you have 15 minutes to convince the examiners of the value of the work you have done.

The remainder of the exam will be sufficient time to ask a good mixture of questions on the project, during which you will get a chance to ``defend'' the work that you submitted in written form.

It's not a sales pitch, but you do need to ``sell your work'' in some sense of the expression - sometimes the best way to do so is focussing on the work that you have already done, and sometimes that is to present something additional to the work done - but as I personally do not have a preference, and will not penalise anyone for doing one or the other.

\hypertarget{what-not-to-do}{%
\section{What not to do}\label{what-not-to-do}}

Do not show up un-prepared - plan what you want to say, figure out how you are going to say it, and practice the presentation a couple of times before the defence.

The corollary of the point above is the only thing that I do not recommend, which is to spend all of your presentation time highlighting all of the flaws in your work - it is good to have perspective on the work, but if the perspective is all negative it can create a highly critical atmosphere.

I.e. if you spend all of your presentation time making your work sound poor, it can keep the focus there for the remainder of the defence. If, on the other hand, the shortcomings are, for example, ``challenges to be overcome in future projects'' and oversimplifications in your model are ``areas that you want to develop the model further'', then you are able to direct the focus towards progress and achievement, rather than inadequacies in your work.

\hypertarget{what-is-of-value-in-academia}{%
\section{What is of value in academia?}\label{what-is-of-value-in-academia}}

This is a rather dangerous question to try to answer in a little blurb on the internet, but I will hazard a short suggestion. The only reason I am mentioning anything like this here is that after submitting your written assignment, you might realise that some part of the assignment was lacking in quality.

There are a few things that good quality academic work often demonstrates, some of which can be highlighted indirectly in a presentation of your project:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  A careful consideration of the area of research and in doing so found a particular issue you would like to investigate or address.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Example:} "We approached the \_\_\_\_ area of economics since we were interested to find out \_\_\_"
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Consultation of academic literature on both the area in question and the specific problem.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Example:} ``One of the first authors to investigate the issue, \emph{`Name'}, raised \_\_\_\_ concerns, which still apply to research in the area today''
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Consultation of literature on previous attempts to investigate the problem and the methods that previous researchers have used.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Example:} "Several approaches have been taken to investigate the topic, \emph{`name'} first used \_\_\_, and \emph{`name'} was able to mitigate some of the problems faced by\ldots. in \ldots"
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A clear understanding of the choice of method, the method itself and the limitations thereof.
\item
  A careful and appropriate application of a method to the problem, taking care not to over-reach in the interpretation of results.
\item
  A clear line of reasoning from start to finish.
\end{enumerate}

The examples used in this section (excluding the plotly interactive plots at the bottom) can all be found in a complete RMarkdown file called ``SingleDocument.Rmd'' in \href{https://github.com/robabsmith/Rmarkdown-project-template}{one of my other GitHub repositories, here.}

\section{Example data sourcing and manipulation}\label{example-data-sourcing-and-manipulation}}

One of the benefits of online database API access is that you can readily source up to date data directly from web locations without having to save files locally in advance.

Most of the major data providers have easy to handle R packages for directly importing data while building your document. The following code chunk requires several packages to be installed:

\hypertarget{loading-the-required-packages}{%
\subsection{Loading the required packages}\label{loading-the-required-packages}}

The first \texttt{sapply} function is just a nice abbreviation that can be used to run the \texttt{require}command for all of the packages listed in the preceding vector. It can of course be modified to run any function.

The second part is particularly useful when writing PDF documents, as you can set the standard chunk options up front in your document and adjust all image settings at once if you choose to change your document setup.

These packages are mostly used in setting up additional plot options for ggplot 2 for aesthetic purposes, like controlling the colour palette, the location and size of the legend etc. All of that plotting code is included just before the plots below.

\subsection{Adding some extra plotting options}\label{adding-some-extra-plotting-options}}

This section includes some additional code that makes writing a document a little more user friendly.

The first part includes some directory specifications, based on the
location that the user saves this file.

The second part includes a number of ggplot2 theme and colour palette
modifications that can be modified for personal preference.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The line-width for all line plots in the document.
\item
  Palettes with shades of red, black, blue for 4 5 and 6 variables.
\item
  A mixed colour palette of 10 colours for categorical variables.
\item
  Alternative legend placements inside the plotting area.
  (This saves a lot of space in the final document).
\item
  Percentage formats that work with latex and ggplot2.
\item
  Simplified command to introduce dashed lines for 5 and 6 variables.
\item
  A theme adjustment to reduce font size in all plots.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Plotting the data}\label{plotting-the-data}}

Creating a plot for the data depends quite critically on the structure of the data that you provide to the function. ggplot2 is most effective when you keep your data in ``long-format'', which basically means that all descriptive and categorising variables have their own columns and the ``values'' that each observation take are located in a single long column. This is structure is terrible for human comprehension but much easier to process programatically.

The plot that follows is a line plot of Danish interest rates. Note the places where you need to record the ``fig.caption'' and ``caption'' labels. \texttt{fig.cap\ =\ "Danish\ interest\ rates"} is included in the code chunk, whereas,
\texttt{caption\ =\ "Source:\ Statistics\ Denmark\ (Danmarks\ Statistik),\ own\ calculations"} is included in the \texttt{labs}options for the plot.

With minor modifications to the \texttt{aes} (aesthetics) properties, you can automatically change all plots to be filled in for these density plots. The Fill aesthetic is not available for all \texttt{geom}'s, so you will need to investigate the options for the ones that you are interested in.

You can see that I have also modified the number of rows in the legend to 6, to keep the legend narrower - since it overlaps the data in the top right corner. Additional legend options \href{https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/guide_legend.html}{can be seen here}. The identical legend settings and titles for \texttt{col} and \texttt{fill} prevent duplicate legends from being created. you can test this out by modifying one of the title texts.

The two options \texttt{theme\_extra}, and \texttt{legend\_top\_right\_inside}, are created above in the additional charting options section, and illustrate one way to keep your plotting code a little cleaner.

A scatter plot with labels on all points can be easily created (some axis limits for the data were necessary below). I also wanted uniform dot sizes and so simply used \texttt{Value\ /\ Value} which returns \texttt{1} for all dot sizes.
