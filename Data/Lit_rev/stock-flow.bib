abstract = {Some fundamental issues of fiscal and monetary policy are discussed within a stock-flow-consistent macroeconomic framework for an open economy. The core of the model is the financial sector with both a capital market and a money market and correspondingly differing interest rates. Further key elements are households which maximize an inter-temporal utility function with respect to both consumption and wealth, profit maximizing firms subject to a production function with decreasing returns to scale, and government expenses funded by both taxes and public debt. Concerning monetary policy, different regimes are discussed, including monetary abstinence, quantitative easing, and monetizing public debt. Typical Keynesian policy measures such as rising wages, expansionary monetary policy, and public deficit spending are also discussed. The main focus is on long term effects of these measures, with the dynamics being only briefly sketched. Because the model is entirely solvable analytically, it may also be useful as a means of didactics.

@phdthesis{Berglund2005,
abstract = {We develop in this dissertation an integrated, flexible system of macroeconomic accounting and modeling. The hallmark of the system is that its accounting framework is stock-flow consistent, meaning that it accounts exhaustively for all stocks of assets in the economy, and that it connects every asset to corresponding flows of property income, investment and holding gains. The accounting system takes the form of an interrelated set of social accounting matrices (SAMs), into which stocks and flows of funds are fitted as continuous-time variables. The nominal value of each variable is decomposed into prices and volumes in a way that secures consistency in aggregation as well as “self-duality” (i.e., that prices × volumes = nominal values). This is accomplished by means of Divisia integral chain indices.    The accounting framework is brought to life by a set of differential equations describing the economic behavior of the agents of the model economy. These equations can be specified in different ways in order to achieve different “closures” of the model, subject to the same set of accounting restrictions. The model featured in the dissertation serves mainly as an example of how this can be done; it is not intended as a conclusive statement about the “right” way to model an economy.    The distinguishing feature of the modeling system is that the behavioral specifications are cast in terms of growth rates and “contributions to growth” rather than levels of prices and volumes. Levels are obtained through numerical evaluation of the integrals of the growth rates. The resulting integrals are path-dependent and thus not expressible in closed form. This novel approach secures consistency between the model and the underlying data, in the sense that both are based on the chain-index principle, in line with recent official statistical practice.},

Particular attention is paid to their role in enhancing a borrowing-induced expansion, a housing boom and an appreciation in the prices of mortgage-backed securities that are of temporary nature. The results from simulation experiments provide support to the view that the combination of risky financial practices with wage stagnation can increase the likelihood of financial instability in a macro system.},

We adopt a stock–flow consistent (SFC) approach with an emphasis on the dynamics of the labour market. We numerically solve the model using a combination of estimation and calibration to generate statistics for our key variables, reflecting features of the Danish economy. We then analyse the effects of a fall in the unemployment compensation rate on the economy. The results indicate that a fall in the compensation rate at a macro level leads to a trade-off between a fall in aggregate demand and a rise in net exports. Due to this trade-off, the net effect of a fall in the compensation rate on the aggregate unemployment rate tends to be weak. Our analyses in this paper raise several questions on the existing views regarding unemployment benefits adopted by a large strand of the economic literature. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Author.},

abstract = {By synthesizing stock-flow consistent models, input–output models, and aspects of ecological macroeconomics, a method is developed to simultaneously model monetary flows through the financial system, flows of produced goods and services through the real economy, and flows of physical materials through the natural environment. This paper highlights the linkages between the physical environment and the economic system by emphasizing the role of the energy industry. A conceptual model is developed in general form with an arbitrary number of sectors, while emphasizing connections with the agent-based, econophysics, and complexity economics literature. First, we use the model to challenge claims that 0{\%} interest rates are a necessary condition for a stationary economy and conduct a stability analysis within the parameter space of interest rates and consumption parameters of an economy in stock-flow equilibrium. Second, we analyze the role of energy price shocks in contributing to recessions, incorporating several propagation and amplification mechanisms. Third, implied heat emissions from energy conversion and the effect of anthropogenic heat flux on climate change are considered in light of a minimal single-layer atmosphere climate model, although the model is only implicitly, not explicitly, linked to the economic model.

The paper adopts the Post-Keynesian Stock Flow Consistent modeling approach to analyze the process of development triggered by the emergence of a new-innovative productive sector into the economic system. The model depicts a multi-sectorial economy composed of consumption and capital goods industries, a banking sector and two households sectors: capitalists and wage earners. Furthermore, it provides an explicit representation of the stock market. In line with the Schumpeterian tradition, our work highlights the cyclical nature of the development process and stresses the relevance of the finance-innovation nexus, analyzing the feed-back effects between the real and financial sides of the economic system. In this way we aim at setting the basis of a comprehensive and coherent framework to study the relationship between technological change, demand and finance along the structural change process triggered by technological innovation.

While the real side of the economy is generally well-explained in macroeconomic models, the financial side of the economy and its interaction with the real economy remains poorly-understood. This paper makes an attempt to model the interdependencies between the real and financial side of the economy in Denmark while adopting a stock-flow-consistent approach. The model is estimated using Danish data for the period 1995-2016. The model is simulated to create a baseline scenario for the period 2017-2030, against which the effects of two standard shocks (fiscal shocks and interest rate shocks) are analysed. Overall, our model is able to replicate the stylized facts as will be discussed. While the model structure is fairly simple due to different constraints, the use of stock-flow approach makes it possible to explain several transmission mechanism through which real economic behaviour can affect the balance sheets, and at the same time capture the feedback effects from the balance sheets to the real economy. Finally, we discuss certain limitations of our model.},

abstract = {The European banking and sovereign debt crisis has revealed severe financial imbalances among countries and institutional sectors. In reaction, economic policy and theory has focused on the role of finance in mitigating economic imbalances and finding ways to deal with them. Policy makers launched data gap initiatives to enhance economic and financial statistics, an important pillar of these initiatives being the integrated framework of the System of National Accounts, unifying product, income, capital, and financial accounts. In this framework, there are elaborated Stock-Flow Consistent models that model any interconnections of institutional sectors, in both real and financial aspects, in a consistent way. This article aims to illustrate the principles and possibilities of Stock Flow Consistent models and their relation to the System of National Acounts. To accomplish this, we construct a simplified Stock Flow Consistent model applied to the sectoral (im)balances between the private, government, and foreign sectors, which were a notable feature of the recent European crisis. {\textcopyright} 2017-Center for Economic Integration, Sejong Institution, Sejong University.},

abstract = {We propose a mean-field approximation to a stock-flow consistent agent-based macroeconomic model with heterogeneous firms and households. Depending on their investment elasticity to past profits, firms can be either aggressive or conservative. Conversely, households are divided into investor and noninvestor groups, depending on whether or not they invest a portion of their wealth in the stock market. Both firms and households dynamically change their type according to transition probabilities specified exogenously. The mean-field approximation consists of homogenizing the balance-sheet variables for agents (firms or households) of the same type and computing the time evolution of the corresponding average as a combination of the deterministic dynamic, derived from investment and consumption decisions before a change of type, and the probabilistic change in type, with an appropriate rebalancing to take stock-flow consistency into account. The last step of the approximation consists in replacing the underlying Markov chain with a continuous-time diffusive limit. We present numerical experiments showing the accuracy of the approximation and the sensitivity of the model with respect to several discretionary parameters. {\textcopyright} 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.},

abstract = {The Eurozone crisis has revitalized the debate between economists on the role played by wages in open economies. Salaries paid to workers are at the same time a fundamental source of aggregate demand and a determinant of firms' international cost competitiveness. The paper investigates how alternative wage growth patterns impact on the economic dynamics of an artificial Monetary Union. For this sake, we perform several experiments employing the Agent Based-Stock Flow Consistent (AB-SFC) Multi-Country model first presented in Caiani et al. (2018a). Results show that a change in the wage growth pattern impacts in non-trivial ways on the demand and supply sides of the economies, giving rise to Keynesian and Schumpeterian effects. When occurring in a single country, wage expansions lead to a transitory deterioration of the country current account and to a slow-down of the economy in the short-run. However, on a longer time-span, higher wages tend to improve firms' innovative performance by strengthening the process of Schumpeterian competition, providing long-run benefits in terms of higher labor productivity which allow the economy to recover. Conversely, a coordinated expansion of wages in all countries, which leaves their relative competitive position unaffected, tends to benefit real GDP, labor productivity growth, and countries' public finance, while not affecting unemployment and countries' external balance. A specular dynamics characterizes the experiments investigating the effects of wage moderation. Extensive sensitivity experiments show that these results are robust to different dimensions of the Monetary Union and that the efficacy of coordinated wage expansionary strategies is enhanced when consumers give more importance to price differentials in their consumption allocation decisions. {\textcopyright} 2018},

abstract = {Various examples of complementary currencies have recently emerged in Europe in response to the impact of the 2007 financial crisis. They have been variously labelled as social, local and alternative money but their economic meaning has still to be discussed. On the one hand, they have been hailed as innovative tools for socioterritorial policies with a focus on localist, anti-globalist and anti-capitalist values. On the other, the emphasis on the value of currencies as instruments of alternative territorial development runs the risk of overshadowing issues concerning the specific features of such projects. The first part of this paper puts forward an interpretation of the current situation as a crisis of the liquidity principle and suggests that the principle of clearing instead represents the primary point of reference for any institutional arrangement aimed at restoring a balanced relationship between lenders and borrowers. A critical review of known European complementary monetary circuits is followed by examination of the Sardex clearing system. The paper then goes on to argue by means of a stock-flow consistent model that complementary monetary circuits can serve to stabilise local economic systems. In particular, a local clearing union for local exchanges has the effect of stabilising the profits of firms while attenuating the impact of the credit crunch at same time. {\textcopyright} The Author 2016.},

abstract = {The emergence and persistence of large trade imbalances as well as the volatility of financial flows among countries have been attributed, at least in part, to the inadequacy of the current international monetary system after the breakdown of Bretton Woods. From a different perspective, the current eurozone crisis is also the result, in our view, of a flawed institutional setting. These problems call for reforms to mitigate or avoid the recessionary bias that is the outcome of current systems, as Keynes predicted in the discussion preceding the Bretton Woods agreements. In this paper we briefly review the evidence on international imbalances, and survey the rapidly growing literature on the subject. We introduce a set of models based on the stock-flow-consistent approach pioneered by Godley (1999) and Lavoie and Godley (2003). We discuss how to use these models to explore potential reform of the international monetary system. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The paper proposes a post Keynesian framework to explain Tobin's q behavior in the long run. The theoretical basis is informed by the Cambridge corporate model originally proposed by Kaldor (1966), which is reinterpreted here as a theory for q. The core of the "Kaldorian q theory is a negative long-run relation between q and growth rates, a negative relation between q and propensities to consume, and the fact that q can be different from 1 in the long-run equilibrium. We generalize this model through a medium-scale stock-flow consistent (SFC) model, which introduces important post Keynesian aspects missing in the Kaldorian model, such as endogenous money, a financial system, and inflation. We extend the model to include a more realistic treatment of firms' financial structure decisions and allow the interdependence between these decisions and dividend policy. Numerical simulations confirm that the original Kaldorian relations between q and growth rates and propensities to consume hold, but unlike the original model, in our model, q is not independent of how firms finance their investment. We also confirm the possibility of q being different from 1 in the long run. Finally, we contrast this "post Keynesian q theory" with the Miller-Modigliani dividend irrelevance proposition and the neoclassical investment and financial theory. It is shown that its validity depends crucially on the value taken by q: for q values different from 1 the proposition will not hold and dividend policy will be relevant for equity valuation. Therefore, post Keynesian q theory stands against the main predictions of mainstream finance and constitutes an alternative for developing a macroeconomic theory for equity markets.

returns depending on the direction of the news, the state of the economy
and the flow-through ability of the sector. The impact of positive
surprises affects the abnormal returns of many more sectors than does
the impact of negative surprises, especially in the low states of

that combines the stock-flow consistent approach of Godley and Lavoie
with the flow-fund model of Georgescu-Roegen. The model has the
following key features. First, monetary and physical stocks and flows
are explicitly formalised taking into account the accounting principles
and the laws of thermodynamics. Second, Georgescu-Roegen's distinction
between stock-flow and fund-service resources is adopted. Third, output
is demand-determined but supply constraints might arise either due to
environmental damages or due to the exhaustion of natural resources.
Fourth, climate change influences directly the components of aggregate
demand. Fifth, finance affects macroeconomic activity and the
materialisation of investment plans that determine ecological
efficiency. The model is calibrated using global data. Simulations are
conducted to investigate the trajectories of key environmental,
macroeconomic and financial variables under (i) different assumptions
about the sensitivity of economic activity to the leverage ratio of
firms and (ii) different types of green finance policies. (C) 2016 The

abstract = {In the era of financialization, increasing income inequality could be observed in most developed and many developing countries. Despite similar developments in inequality, the growth performance and drivers for growth differed markedly among countries, allowing clusters of different growth regimes to be identified. Among them are 2 extreme types: the debt-led private-demand boom and the export-led mercantilist economies. Whereas the former rely mainly on credit-financed household consumption in order to compensate for the potential lack of demand (associated with the depressing effect of financialisation), the latter rely on net exports as the main driver of aggregate demand. Using a stock-flow consistent model it will be demonstrated how increasing inequality, depending on a countries institutional structure and regulatory framework, affects growth differently, explaining the occurrence of both regime types.

abstract = {This paper presents a macroeconomic model that combines the economic impact of climate change with the pivotal role of private debt. Using a Stock-Flow Consistent approach based on the Lotka–Volterra logic, we couple its nonlinear monetary dynamics of underemployment and income distribution with abatement costs. A calibration of our model at the scale of the world economy enables us to simulate various planetary scenarios. Our findings are threefold: 1) the +2 °C target is already out of reach, absent negative emissions; 2) the long-term (resp. short-term) results of climate change on economic fundamentals may lead to severe economic consequences without the implementation (resp. in case of too rapid an application) of proactive climate policies. Global warming (resp. too fast transition) forces the private sector to leverage in order to compensate for output and capital losses (resp. to lower carbon emissions), thus endangering financial stability; 3) Implementing an adequate carbon price trajectory, as well as increasing the wage share, fostering employment, and reducing private debt make it easier to avoid unintended degrowth and to reach a +2.5 °C target.

abstract = {This paper develops a simple two-country stock-flow-consistent model based on that of Godley and Lavoie. In order to motivate the use of stabilisation policies, persistent inflationary pressure and endogenous economic cycles are introduced into the model. Three scenarios are then simulated: a step decrease in real exports from country B, increased wage pressure in country B and an income tax cut in country A. In all cases, monetary and fiscal policies in isolation enjoy little success, but a combined monetary and fiscal approach to stabilisation proves highly effective. Moreover, the model suggests that the pursuit of autonomous inflation targeting in each country introduces excessive exchange rate volatility relative to an alternative rule in which one central bank takes a leading role in interest rate setting. {\textcopyright} The Author 2014.

To this purpose, we employ an enriched version of the agent-based Eurace macroeconomic model, where we have included an energy sector with a fossil-fuel power producer as well as a renewable-energy based one. Both power producers take pricing and capacity investment decisions based on the price of imported fossil fuel and the feed-in tariff government policy. Results show that the feed-in tariff policy is effective in fostering the sustainability transition of the energy sector and that it increases the level of investments with a positive impact on the unemployment rates. Moreover, we observe that its financing costs do not impact government finances, which actually improve following the better economic conditions. For high policy intensity, however, we observe an increasing GDP share of the investment sector in the economy, due to the building-up of renewable production capacity, with a resulting crowding out of consumption, higher interest rates and prices. The final outcome on household well-being therefore depends on what extent the chosen value judgment recognizes the importance of an economically and ecologically sustainable growth path.

It does so in two steps. First, it phrases the representative views of Davidson, Godley, Minsky and Tobin as different 'closures' of the same (SFC) accounting framework, calling attention to their similarities and logical implications. Second, it discusses unresolved issues within this approach and how it differs from 'modern' theorising. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The model consists of various household groups that receive income from different sources or from the same sources in different proportions. The dynamic linkage between functional and personal income distribution is formulated as part of a complete macroeconomic system. Inequality decomposition techniques are employed to associate income sources with personal income distribution. Simulation exercises are conducted to reveal the various ways through which functional and personal income distribution interact. In the simulations, a rise in the exogenous component of low-skilled workers' wage share reduces inequality in the short run; in the medium to long run inequality starts increasing due to certain macroeconomic developments, but remains lower than its initial level in almost all cases. A change in functional income distribution due to a rise in the dividend payout ratio of firms increases inequality both in the short run and the long run. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The stock-flow consistent (SFC) modelling approach, grounded in the pioneering work of Wynne Godley and James Tobin in the 1970s, has been adopted by a growing number of researchers in macroeconomics, especially after the publication of Monetary Economics by Godley and Lavoie, which provided a general framework for the analysis of whole economic systems, and the recognition that macroeconomic models integrating real markets with flow-of-funds analysis had been particularly successful in predicting the Great Recession of 2007-2009. We introduce the general features of the SFC approach for a closed economy, showing how the core model has been extended to address issues such as financialization and income distribution. We next discuss the implications of the approach for models of open economies and compare the methodologies adopted in developing SFC empirical models for whole countries. We review the contributions where the SFC approach is being adopted as the macroeconomic closure of microeconomic agent-based models, and how the SFC approach is at the core of new research in ecological macroeconomics. Finally, we discuss the appropriateness of the name 'SFC' for the class of models we survey. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {In this paper, we build a generalized two-sector Kaleckian growth model and explore the dynamics towards long-run positions. The model incorporates conflicting claims of labour and firms over income distribution and endogenous labour-saving technical progress. Adopting a stock-flow consistent framework, our simulation experiments yield the following results. First, the ‘paradox of thrift' and the ‘paradox of costs' hold, meaning that lower saving rates generate higher growth rates while higher real wages generate higher profit rates, but the magnitude of the impact depends on the initial status of income distribution and monetary policy. Second, changes in autonomous labour-saving innovations might explain the phenomenon of the ‘New Economy' of the second half of the 1990s within an alternative framework. Our simulations with a two-sector model retrieve the analytical results achieved with a one-sector Kaleckian model, with the addition of path dependence. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {This paper deploys a simple stock-flow consistent (SFC) model in order to examine various contentions regarding fiscal and monetary policy. It follows from the model that if the fiscal stance is not set in the appropriate fashion - that is, at a well-defined level and growth rate - then full employment and low inflation will not be achieved in a sustainable way. We also show that fiscal policy on its own could achieve both full employment and a target rate of inflation. Finally, we arrive at two unconventional conclusions: (1) that an economy (described within an SFC framework) with a real rate of interest net of taxes that exceeds the real growth rate will not generate explosive interest flows, even when the government is not targeting primary surpluses, and (2) that it cannot be assumed that a debtor country requires a trade surplus if interest payments on debt are not to explode. {\textcopyright} 2007 M.E.

abstract = {The paper moves from a discussion of the challenges posed by the crisis to standard macroeconomics and the solutions adopted within the DSGE community. Although several recent improvements have enhanced the realism of standard models, we argue that major drawbacks still undermine their reliability. In particular, DSGE models still fail to recognize the complex adaptive nature of economic systems, and the implications of money endogeneity. The paper argues that a coherent and exhaustive representation of the inter-linkages between the real and financial sides of the economy should be a pivotal feature of every macroeconomic model and proposes a macroeconomic framework based on the combination of the Agent Based and Stock Flow Consistent approaches. The papers aims at contributing to the nascent AB-SFC literature under two fundamental respects: first, we develop a fully decentralized AB-SFC model with several innovative features, and we thoroughly validate it in order to check whether the model is a good candidate for policy analysis applications. Results suggest that the properties of the model match many empirical regularities, ranking among the best performers in the related literature, and that these properties are robust across different parameterizations. Second, the paper has also a methodological purpose in that we try to provide a set or rules and tools to build, calibrate, validate, and display AB-SFC models. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {We revisit the old but still vibrant Post-Keynesian debate over 'fully-adjusted positions', defined by the long-run equality of actual and standard utilisation rates. The central proposition of this paper is that in a world where different groups inside and outside firms have different objectives, the equality of actual and standard utilisation should not be treated as the only possible long-run equilibrium condition. The argument is illustrated in a model of target return pricing with conflict inflation, building on the work of Marc Lavoie. A 'common language' for the conflicting claims by shareholders, managers and workers is developed in terms of target profit rates, and it is shown that these contradictory claims can be partly reconciled through variations in the utilisation rate. The analysis unifies history and equilibrium in the sense that the nature of final equilibrium position and the adjustment to it depend on the objectives of the dominant social groups. We distinguish a 'Fordist regime' and a 'financialisation regime' and produce simulation results within a simple stock-flow consistent model that are broadly consistent with the stylised facts of these distinct historical phases of capitalism.

context of stock-flow consistent models. We begin with an extension of
the Goodwin-Keen model incorporating time deposits, government bills,
cash, and central bank reserves to the base model with loans and demand
deposits, and use it to describe a fractional reserve banking system. We
then characterize narrow banking by a full reserve requirement on demand
deposits and describe the resulting separation between the payment
system and lending functions of the resulting banking sector. By way of
numerical examples, we explore the properties of fractional and full
reserve versions of the model and compare their asymptotic properties.
We find that narrow banking does not lead to any loss in economic growth
when both versions of the model converge to a finite equilibrium, while
allowing for more direct monitoring and prevention of financial
breakdowns in the case of explosive asymptotic behavior.},

addition, a discussion emerged on the negative socio-economic and

Nevertheless, pathways for phasing out fossil fuel subsidies in high

we extend the EIRIN Stock-Flow Consistent behavioral model to study the

to subsidize energy investments in green capital (e.g. solar panels),
either via fiscal policies or green bonds. We assess the effects on
green growth, employment, credit and bonds market, as well as the
distributive effects across heterogeneous households and sectors. A
smooth phasing out of fossil fuels subsidies contributes to improve
macroeconomic performance, to decrease inequality and helps the
government to find fiscal space to support stable renewable energy
policies. Renewable energy subsidies contribute to foster the low-carbon
transition but could imply distributive effects, depending on the way in
which they are implemented.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the question of whether a capitalist economy can ever sustain a 'stationary' (or non-growing) state, or whether, as often claimed, capitalism has an inherent 'growth imperative' arising from the charging of interest on debt. We outline the development of a dedicated system dynamics macro-economic model for describing Financial Assets and Liabilities in a Stock-Flow consistent Framework (FALSTAFF) and use this model to explore the potential for stationary state outcomes in an economy with balanced trade, credit creation by banks, and private equity. Contrary to claims in the literature, we find that neither credit creation nor the charging of interest on debt creates a 'growth imperative' in and of themselves. This finding remains true even when capital adequacy and liquidity requirements are imposed on banks. We test the robustness of our results in the face of random variations and one-off shocks. We show further that it is possible to move from a growth path towards a stationary state without either crashing the economy or dismantling the system. Nonetheless, there remain several good reasons to support the reform of the monetary system. Our model also supports critiques of austerity and underlines the value of countercyclical spending by government. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper argues that the expansion may, indeed, continue through 2004 and for some time beyond. But with the government and external deficits both so large and the private sector so heavily indebted, satisfactory growth in the medium term cannot be achieved without a large, sustained and discontinuous increase in net export demand. It is doubtful whether this will happen spontaneously and it certainly will not happen without a cut in domestic absorption of goods and services by the US which would impart a deflationary impulse to the rest of the world. We make no short term forecast. Instead, using a model rooted in a consistent system of stock and flow variables, we trace out a range of possible medium term scenarios in order to evaluate strategic predicaments and policy options without being at all precise about timing.},

abstract = {This paper explores the hypothesis (most notably made by French
economist Thomas Piketty) that slow growth rates lead to rising
inequality. If true, this hypothesis would pose serious challenges to
achieving `prosperity without growth' or meeting the ambitions of those
who call for an intentional slowing down of growth on ecological
grounds. It would also create problems of social justice in the context
of a `secular stagnation'. The paper describes a closed, demand-driven,
stock-flow consistent model of Savings, Inequality and Growth in a
Macroeconomic framework (SIGMA) with exogenous growth and savings rates.
SIGMA is used to examine the evolution of inequality in the context of
declining economic growth. Contrary to the general hypothesis, we find
that inequality does not necessarily increase as growth slows down. In
fact, there are certain conditions under which inequality can be reduced
significantly, or even eliminated entirely, as growth declines. The
paper discusses the implications of this finding for questions of
employment, government fiscal policy and the politics of de-growth. (C)

abstract = {This dissertation consists of three independent essays. The first essay, “Long Waves and Short Cycles in a Model of Endogenous Financial Fragility,” presents a stock flow consistent macroeconomic model in which financial fragility in firm and household sectors evolves endogenously through the interaction between real and financial sectors. Changes in firms' and households' financial practices produce long waves. The Hopf bifurcation theorem is applied to clarify the conditions for the existence of limit cycles, and simulations illustrate stable limit cycles. The long waves are characterized by periodic economic crises following long expansions. Short cycles, generated by the interaction between effective demand and labor market dynamics, fluctuate around the long waves.   The second essay,“Macroeconomic Implications of Financialization,” examines macroeconomic effects of changes in firms' financial behavior (retention policy, equity financing, debt financing), and household saving and portfolio decisions using models that pay explicit attention to financial stock-flow relations. Unlike the first essay, the second essay focuses on the effects of financial change on steady growth path. The results are insensitive to the precise specification of household saving behavior but depend critically on the labor market assumptions (labor-constrained vs dual) and the specification of the investment function (Harrodian vs stagnationist).   The last essay, “Finance, Sectoral Structure and the Big Push,” studies the role of finance in the presence of investment complementarities using a big push model. Due to complementarities between different investment projects, simultaneous industrialization of many sectors (big push) may be needed for an underdeveloped economy to escape from an underdevelopment trap. Such simultaneous industrialization requires costly coordination by a third party, such as the government. Some recent papers show that private banks with significant market power may also solve the problem of coordination failure. We show that private coordination may not work since even large private banks may find it more profitable to finance firms in the traditional sector than in the modern sector.},

induce Resource-saving technological change to achieve a greener

leaning-against-the-wind interest-rate policy rules within a

generates endogenous booms and busts along credit cycles. As feed back
loops on aggregate demand affect the goods and the labor markets, the
real and the financial sides of the economy are closely interconnected.
The baseline scenario is able to qualitatively reproduce a wide range of

movements in the net worth of firms significantly dampens the credit
cycles and reduces the employment costs of financial crises, because
this indicator incorporates early signals of financial imbalances.
Performances of this three-mandate Taylor rule are also more robust to
the specific parameter values and regulatory framework than the standard
dual-mandate Taylor rules. Nonetheless, none of the policy rules under
study completely eliminates the high employment costs of financial
crises. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Our society faces a dilemma. While continued economic growth is
ecologically unsustainable, low or negative rates of economic growth are
accompanied by adverse social impacts. Hence there is a need for
macroeconomic tools that can help identify socially sustainable
post-growth pathways. The emerging field of ecological macroeconomics
aims to address this need and features a number of new macroeconomic
modelling approaches. This article provides (1) a review of modelling
developments in ecological macroeconomics, based on the literature and
interviews with researchers, and (2) an analysis of how the different
models incorporate policy themes from the post-growth literature.
Twenty-two ecological macroeconomic models were analysed and compared to
eight policy themes. It was found that environmental interactions and
the monetary system were treated most comprehensively. Themes of income
inequality, work patterns, indicators of well-being, and disaggregated
production were addressed with less detail, while alternative business
models and cross-scale interactions were hardly addressed. Overall, the
combination of input-output analysis with stock-flow consistent
modelling was identified as a promising avenue for developing
macroeconomic models for a post-growth economy. However, due to the wide
interpretation of what ``the economy{\{}''{\}} entails, future research will
benefit from employing a range of approaches.(C) 2017 The Authors.

abstract = {The Great Recession that followed the financial crisis of 2007 is not
only the largest economic crisis after the Great Depression of the
1930s, it also signals a crisis of economics as a discipline. This is
not only the consequence of the inadequacy of mainstream macroeconomics,
and specifically the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)
workhorse model, to forecast such a huge event, or at least to detect
the worrying tendencies towards it. Even more relevant is the choice to
explicitly avoid the modeling of large crises (that for someone is a
motivation for not attacking pre-crisis DSGE models focused on the
analysis of small deviations from the steady-state), so denying the
intrinsic nature of capitalism, a system that necessarily proceeds
through cycles and (extended) crises. The replies of the DSGE approach
to critics have led to extensions regarding for instance the role of
financial frictions, heterogeneous agents, and bounded rationality
(though typically in the form of quasirational expectations). The
alternative paradigm of agent-based (AB) macroeconomics can take into
account all these elements at once within an evolutionary modeling
framework based on heterogeneity and interaction, so capable to
endogenously reproduce complex dynamics, from small fluctuations to
large crises, due to innovation and industrial dynamics, rising
inequality and financial instability, and so on. The integration between
AB macroeconomics and the (post-Keynesian) stock-flow consistent
approach represents a promising way for the future development of this
research field.},

abstract = {Keynesian models of household behavior suggest that a shift in the distribution of income toward profits - or toward rentiers - should imply an increase in the propensity to save out of income for the population as a whole. However, the available empirical evidence for the United States shows that, starting in 1985, the propensity to save out of income for the household sector has decreased steadily. Starting in 1981, the share of income accruing to the richest 5 percent of the population increased steadily, with wide fluctuations related to capital gains on equities and, more recently, in the housing market. The aim of this paper is to lay down a growth model, grounded in the Post Keynesian stock-flow-consistent approach of Godley and Lavoie, to analyze the links between consumption and saving behavior of two classes of households - financial markets and the housing market. The model will be used from a theoretical perspective to analyze the dynamics of markets along a steady growth path. {\textcopyright} 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.},

several fiscal policies in monetary union. Five variants are analyzed:
restrictive fiscal policy in the south, fiscal expansion in the south,
fiscal expansion in the north, fiscal expansion in the whole area
without and with intra-zone financing. Several findings emerge and
illustrate the mechanisms at work in the crisis countries of Southern
Europe. The establishment of a restrictive fiscal policy in South
reduces public debt and the level of interest rates but at the cost of
slower growth. The effect of a policy of increasing demand in the south
is effective on growth but interest rates greatly increase. To avoid the
explosion rates in southern countries without jeopardizing growth, only
a political stimulus north can both boost production and reduce
imbalances within the euro area. Finally, a recovery policy in the whole
area is effective growth while limiting the increase in interest rates
as long as financing intra-zone is important.},

abstract = {This paper develops a stock-flow consistent macrodynamic model in which firms' and banks' desired margins of safety play a central role in macroeconomic performance. The model incorporates an active banking sector and pays particular attention to the leverage of both firms and banks. It is shown that the endogenous change in the desired margins of safety of firms and banks is likely to transform an otherwise stable debt-burdened economy into an unstable one. The endogeneity of the desired margins of safety can also produce, under certain conditions, investment and leverage cycles during which investment and leverage move both in the same and in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the paper investigates the potential stabilising role of fiscal policy. It is indicated that fiscal policy can reduce the destabilising forces in the macroeconomy when government expenditures adjust adequately to variations in the divergence between the actual and the desired margins of safety. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We study the effects of loans and mortgages securitization on business
cycles by using a large-scale agent-based stock-flow consistent
macroeconomic model and simulator. We enriched the model by including a
financial vehicle corporation, which buys loans and mortgages from banks
and issues asset-backed securities (ABSs) and mortgage-backed securities
(MBSs), and a mutual fund, which invests both in ABSs and MBSs using its
liquidity resources and issues new shares when in liquidity shortage.
Households own the equity of the mutual fund in the form of equity
shares. By means of securitization, banks conduct regulatory capital
arbitrage and reduce risk-weighted assets in their balance sheet, thus
being able to lend more loans and mortgages. Results show that different
levels of securitization propensity are able to affect credit and
business cycles in different manners. On one side, securitization
increases banks' lending activity, influencing positively investment and
consumption. On the other side, the increased amount of credit amplifies
negative shocks, due to higher loans' write-offs probability triggered
by the boosted lending activity. Firms' bankruptcies impact the equity
of banks, affecting their ability to grant new loans to consumption
goods producers (CGPs), which need credit for their production activity,
and mortgages to households, which need them to purchase housing units.
The effect of securitization on the economy critically depends on the
level of securitization propensity and on the time span considered.},

abstract = {We propose a continuous-time stock-flow consistent model for inventory
dynamics in an economy with firms, banks, and households. On the supply
side, firms decide on production based on adaptive expectations for
sales demand and a desired level of inventories. On the demand side,
investment is determined as a function of utilization and profitability
and can be financed by debt, whereas consumption is independently
determined as a function of income and wealth. Prices adjust sluggishly
to both changes in labour costs and inventory. Disequilibrium between
expected sales and demand is absorbed by unplanned changes in inventory.
This results in a five-dimensional dynamical system for wage share,
employment rate, private debt ratio, expected sales, and capacity
utilization. We analyze two limiting cases: the long run dynamics
provides a version of the Keen model with effective demand and varying
inventories, whereas the short-run dynamics gives rise to behaviour that
we interpret as Kitchin cycles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

abstract = {This paper provides a summary of the OECD's new global macroeconometric
model, including an overview of model structure and a selection of
simulations illustrating its main properties. Compared with its
predecessors, the new model is more compact and regionally aggregated,
but gives more weight to the focus of policy interests in global trade
and financial linkages. The country model structures typically combine
short-term Keynesian-type dynamics with a consistent long-run
neo-classical supply-side. While retaining a conventional treatment of
international trade and payments linkages, the model has a greater
degree of stock-flow consistency, with explicit modelling of domestic
and international assets, liabilities and associated income streams.
Account is also taken of the influence of financial and housing market
developments on asset valuation and domestic expenditures via house and
equity prices, interest rates and exchange rates. As a result, the model
gives more prominence to wealth and wealth effects in determining
longer-term outcomes and the role of asset prices in the transmission of
international shocks both to goods and financial markets. (C) 2010
