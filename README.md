# supervision_gitpage

**This is a GitBook page (built using Rmarkdown) to help guide project students at AAU**

This site is a work in progress and will necessarily be updated and improved over time. Any suggestions would be most welcome.

This branch retains only those files needed to host the website, and the files needed to build this website are located in the `main` branch.

It is a bit lengthy, but it should hopefully include some useful info for students that are looking to start a new project, or who might want some basic structural scaffolding.
