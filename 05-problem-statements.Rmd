# Rough guide to writing a problem statement 

Coming up with a good question does not mean coming up with a question
that will change the world. It means coming up with a question that you
can answer **in the time you are allowed**, and **with the tools you
have (or have time to learn)**.

A note on how to get started with your problem selection -- try to be
curious. It is going to take some active effort.

**Most of you have identified an area of interest, rather than any
specific question.** These are just a few pointers to help you to
identify a good problem.

-   If you want to read a pretty good "how-to" guide, try this one:
    <https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Problem-Statement>

You need to actively apply yourselves to *finding* a question:

## Step 1: Brainstorm / ideation

-   Find a meeting room and mind-map an area of economics that you are
    interested in.

-   A very high-level overview of the courses (like the table of
    contents in your textbooks) you have done so far should help you to
    understand the tools that you have, which you can use to answer
    whatever question you end up asking.

    -   Some of these tools will be theories, models, data types and
        sources. The learning outcomes of your courses are also a good
        guide (check Moodle).

-   If you really want to be active in your search for problems, and
    deal with real life issues -- pick up a phone and make some calls to
    people in the area or industry you want to look at. These kinds of
    discussion can be really motivating and insightful.

-   As a group you can really benefit by getting ideas and input from
    each other. This does not need to take a long time but does require
    effort.

-   Don't get caught up by not deciding what to do -- get into a room,
    set a time frame and get finished with the choice early.

Some interesting possible approaches can be seen here -- many of these
are related to innovation to products, but the general ideas can be used
to create research ideas too:

## Step 2: Getting that problem statement clear

Where to start?

Read. This starts with a good literature search.

Some reflective questions that I recommend you consider before the meeting:

1.	What are you investigating (you have a problem statement for this already - but it still lacks some clarity)?
\
    i.e.
    What do you mean by: "årsagen"?
    What do you mean by: "handel med omverden"?
    How do you define globalisation? 
    When you say "påvirke", what do you mean?\
    \
    Is it all people in the USA? All industries? Aggregate economic measures?
    \
    When you talk about effects, it usually implies that there is some kind of causal relationship... When looking at national economic aggregates - there are many possible "causes" for changes. Political, social, economic, technological, etc. 

2.	Why is it important to investigate this?

  1.	Who would care about this result? i.e. why are you doing this research? what is the motivation behind finding an answer to this question?

  2.	What is the problem that you are actually trying to throw some light on?

3.	How have others explored this? 

    1.	What did they find?

    2.	What are some of the conclusions that have been drawn?

    3.	Are there some concerns/issues with how other people have investigated it?

4.	How could you possibly explore this question? 

    1.	Are there some alternative explanations that have not been considered?

    2.	Are there some other perspectives that have been ignored? For example... if the USA is able to strengthen it's trade position, what are the consequences for smaller countries that compete in the same markets?
    
    3.	Is there some new data available that illuminates a new part of the problem?
    
    4.	Are there better measures available for inequality / trade performance / competitiveness / etc. ?
    
5.	How are you going to make the choice about what road to take? 

    1.	If you had all the money and time in the world, how would you investigate this problem?
    
    2.	What are the first steps / minimum requirements needed to be able to answer the question?
    
    3.	What options are real possibilities in the time that is left?
    
    4.	Who is going to do what?


## Using the introduction as the route to the problem statement 

A good introduction leads to a good problem statement, but this is only
possible if you have some good material to work with.

### Example flow of a good introduction

1.  You could list some shocking figures or numbers that highlight that
    there is some area / issue that we should be concerned about. It
    could also be some clear contradiction or controversy in the
    literature that needs clarification - but this requires some careful
    reading. (This defines the problem area that you want to address -
    normally these are the effects of some other problem that can be
    identified.)

2.  You could then explain that some people see (explain) these
    facts/figures from the perspective of A / B / C . . . and conclude
    that X / Y / Z. Another group of researchers suggest that there may
    be another way to interpret these figures.. they say. . . etc. (This
    highlights existing theories in the literature - these could be
    conflicting explanations for the effects that are observed by
    different researchers. Always remember that research can have a
    particular agenda, i.e. to promote efficiency of markets, or to
    critique main-stream literature - so be a little critical when
    reading. Every researcher is trying to sell their ideas.)

3.  Next, you could explain that 'these' different approaches suggest
    that this problem could be investigated by doing E/F/G.
    (Identification of possible ways of addressing the issue - There are
    a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods, and some people
    rely more on some than on others. This section should still be able
    to refer to how other people have addressed the issue. Here is where
    you narrow down what might be a good way to look at the problem.)

4.  More specifically, therefore, we want to investigate how / if / what
    the effects of / etc. (By this stage you should be able to be
    specific about the exact part of the problem that you are interested
    in addressing, and all of the arguments for why it is interesting
    should already have been made.)

## Some general notes about writing a problem statement 

The general structure of questions in most economic analyses is: What
is, has been, or will be the impact of **A** on **B**?

### Where do you find a problem in macroeconomics? 

Many economic queries attempt to measure social consequences, and most
often try to assign a financial value to those consequences. Sometimes
this is phrased as a "comparative outcome" or "alternative scenario".
Normally this means that one option is *better* than another. This is
not surprising, since pretty much all macroeconomic variables are
aggregated financial values or derivatives thereof.

Other ways to frame a question could be:

1.  Why is one option better than the other? How can you tell?

2.  How does a change in X affect income for the economy / households /
 teachers?

3.  How many people are employed?

4.  Labour productivity?

5.  How is the standard of living affected?

These are justification options (evidence) to motivate *why* an
investigation is a good idea. Just remember that you need to be able to
find the evidence to back up your arguments. As noted in the example of
an introduction flow above, your selection of a method should be the
logical conclusion of your reading.

### Answering the Why? 

Why is it that investigating this problem will be beneficial? To answer
the question generally requires awareness of:

1.  What?

2.  When?

3.  Where?

4.  Who?

5.  In what way?

6.  How?

These things are the specifics of the problem statement, but they will
not provide you with the answer to why it is important.

The best place to find an answer to *why?* is to read some of the most
recent work on the topic you have found. Anything that has been
published has been read and edited by at least 5 people by the time it
goes to a journal. The arguments in those articles should therefore be
pretty reasonable.

Once you understand your *why?* you can start with the specifics

### What? 

For example: If you chose to research currency markets, some of the
sub-categories could be (What?):

-   Trading platforms

-   Exchange rate policies

-   Regulations

-   Common currency areas

-   Clearing and settlement systems

-   Speculation

-   Risk-mitigation / hedging

This delimitation is often determined by the problem area that you
identify. Normally illustrated by something interesting or concerning,
which leads you to think that investigating the area might be
interesting.

You can go the other way around, and check what has been written about recently or is
currently being funded at the EU or national levels. Read some of the
latest literature relating to it and then identify if there is a similar
problem in an area that has not yet been investigated.

A third possibility is to open up some of the really amazing data
repositories of major institutions and see if some of those can inspire
you.

### When?

You need to be carefully aware of what time period you choose to
investigate, as it has direct consequences for the types of conclusions
you can make from your analysis. If you look at 1950 -1970 consumption
data, you can't really say anything intelligent about the use of
disposable income in 2020.

Historical analysis is crucial in economics, but you should always be
aware of how the structure of the economies of the world have shifted
over time.

Education rates, the type of institutions that exist, levels of
unemployment, the size of government, etc.

A trendy catch phrase for this kind of context is PESTLE, an anagram for
how the context of countries change:

1.  Political

2.  Economic

3.  Social

4.  Technological

5.  Legal

6.  Environmental

Please **don't write this list out and do a PESTLE analysis** in your
projects, it is just to tell you that there are many changes that take
place over time. And that you need to think specifically about time in
your problem statement.

### Where? 

This is quite obvious but is not only related to geographical borders.
For example, a study could be:

-   National

-   Municipal

-   Regional

-   Global

-   Local (or micro)

### Who? 

Which groups are involved in your project, and who is it that will be
interested in reading the results of your research? Who will the
research / problem investigation be useful or interesting for.

-   Demographic specific (Ex., students, low-income families, employees
 at public institutions)

-   Institution specific (Ex. Banks, the national bank, the stock
 exchange, or one specific institution)

-   Industry specific (Ex. Mining, agriculture, home owners
 associations, mortgage institutes, or alternatively at a "sector"
 level, such as households, firms, government etc.)

-   Country specific

-   Etc.

### In what way? 

You also need to know what kind of impact or relationship you are
looking for. Is it,

-   *How much of the behaviour of A can be explained by B*?

-   Is it a *theoretical or empirical issue* or are you interested in?

-   Or *how much influence will A have on B? Or vice versa, or both*?

-   Is it causal? Are you arguing that one thing is *causing* another
    thing? -- you have to be quite careful trying to do these ones.

### How? 

Finally, you need to be able to explain how you are going to investigate
the problem. You should consider your tools and your course on
methodology (and philosophy of science) to be able to figure out how
will you answer the question.

You can boggle your brain a bit with the wiki-page on philosophy of
science here:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science>

Recall that methodology is layered, a very simplistic way to think about it is
as a hierarchy:

>\> Philosophy of science
>
> \-\> Methodology
>
> \--\> Theory
>
> \-\-\--\> Methods

**You can watch a few videos about what this is:**

1.  This one is pretty good, but a little dry:
    <https://youtu.be/IvwkMxgahA4>

2.  Daniel Hausman - This one has some interesting perspectives (but is
    much better in 2x speed): <https://youtu.be/EfF6WD8s_ps> (but he
    doesn't really list any specific philosophies)

3.  Paul Hoyningen-Huene at Leibniz Universität Hannover has a whole
    course on it if you get really caught up in it -
    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP8teUgZcBY&list=PLGV2ddg-PFGvWKDeTyrUji7TXY8y1SHjl>
    (He is pretty entertaining and you could learn a lot in his course
    -- and have a few laughs at dad jokes -- in 22 lectures)

4.  Marc Lavoie -- This might help if you are interested in locating the theory you are using in either heterodox or orthodox categories of economic methodology. Disclaimer: I do not believe this is a constructive way to categorise methodology, but it is a common way.
<https://youtu.be/DEROFQIao4o>

The philosophy of science defines what kind of results will be
considered valid. For example, is it valid to make a conclusion about
the future based on the past (i.e. to use data to make predictions)?

Some examples of this are:

-   Cartesian / Euclidian philosophies of science

-   The Babylonian mode of thinking

-   Critical realism

-   Scepticism

-   Logical positivism

This colour coded conceptual map of philosophy might put some of the
terms you come across into perspective (with some spin on "education"):

<https://cmapspublic3.ihmc.us/rid%3D1196256709922_36526043_8120/1196256715039I908793757I8261Iimage>

Theories use methods, and methods are part of a particular methodology,
and the methodology is made valid by the theory of science inside which
it fits.

Methods are at the bottom of the pyramid, and can be quantitative or
qualitative, or a combination of both. It is important to be aware of
what you are doing and using. They are normally used to motivate one or
another theory.

This stuff can be extremely dry and boring, or it can also be super
interesting (if you are into it). It is how we know, that we know, that
what we know, is really something factual -- or what a fact is in the
first place. It is closely related to metaphysics, epistemology and
ontology. None of which will help you cook an egg in the morning, but
you might find the study as fascinating as I do (even if I will never
suck up the energy to finish reading Immanuel Kant's *Critique of Pure
Reason*).

This Saunders et al. research onion is a pretty useful way to think
about each of the decisions we make when constructing out research.
